Today it is an integral part of energy policy, economic development, and security. Security means not\u00a0only protection from military aggression, but also maintenance of adequate supplies of food and water, and the protection of public health. These problems cannot be addressed from one discipline or from the perspective of one issue or one country. The world of the future will demand the integration of multiple needs and values across both disciplinary and geographic boundaries.Each year ENRP faculty and fellows produce publications and conduct research on a wide variety of topics.\u00a0Five themes stand out:Integration: Bridging the gap across natural, social, and engineering sciences, the environmental and development communities, multiple sectors of human activity, and geographic and temporal scalesGlobal change: Responding effectively to global environmental threats such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, and environmentally unsustainable economic policiesEnergy: Designing, developing, and implementing economically and environmentally sound energy policiesEconomic Incentives: Assessing the effectiveness of incentive-based environmental regulationSustainability: Meeting human needs for energy, agriculture, and water while protecting environmental quality and biodiversityWhile our projects and activities continue to evolve, our perspective remains global and interdisciplinary, linking the fields of science and policy.\u00a0ENRP looks forward to being an active participant in the environmental policy debate as it evolves over the course of this decade.<br /><br />We are now accepting nominations for the 2020 Roy Family Award for Environmental Partnership.The Roy Award is presented every two years to an outstanding cross-sector partnership that enhances environmental quality through novel and creative approaches.\u00a0 Self-nomination is permissible and encouraged.\u00a0 The deadline to submit a nomination is October 15, 2019.We are looking for partnerships that:have advanced a new idea, model, or paradigm that could be transferable to other issues or geographic regions to improve the quality of the environment;have taken risks that result in significant actions that contribute to solutions and create leverage for greater action;EligibilityAwards are given to programs or projects that:engage in partnership, defined as participation of two or more separate organizations;organizations must operate in at least two different sectors: academic, civic, business, government, or non-profit; andorganizations must work together collaboratively on a project or program that tangibly improves the quality of our environment.Award BenefitsFinalists receive rigorous evaluation based on the award program\u2019s selection criteriaVisibility and recognition from Harvard University that may catalyze expansion or additional partnershipsJoin the prestigious group of award-winning partnerships from around the worldSelection CriteriaInnovation - Demonstrates a leap in creativityEffectiveness - Achieves tangible results\u00a0Significance - Successfully addresses a challenging environmental problemTransferability - Shows promise of inspiring successful replication by others<br /><br />Past Award Winners<br /><br />2018: Advancing Green Infrastructure Program<br /><br />Each year, 257 million gallons of combined sewage flow into surface waterways surrounding New Haven during rain events, exceeding the capacity of the combined sewer system, negatively impacting ecosystem health and quality of life. The contamination and street flooding are the direct result of stormwater runoff from the City\u2019s increasing impervious surface cover, which overload both the combined and storm sewer systems. Constructing added capacity and separating the combined system is an ongoing, expensive, and disruptive process. The Advancing Green Infrastructure partners worked together to develop, pilot, and implement a program that is demonstrating the effectiveness of bioswales to reduce pollution from runoff and prevent street flooding.\u201cAs a low lying, coastal city, New Haven is already experiencing negative impacts of climate change \u2013 its successful effort to address this challenge will rely upon engagement by the entire community,\u201d Mayor Toni N. Harp said of the 2018 Roy Award winner. \u201c\u2026 This program maximizes limited resources to achieve multiple objectives: mitigating the impacts of storm water runoff in an environmentally sustainable way, while creating meaningful employment for some of the city\u2019s most vulnerable residents.\u201d<br /><br />2016: California Healthy Nail Salon Program<br /><br />In partnership with local counties and cities throughout California, the California Healthy Nail Salon Program addresses the environmental health and justice issues faced by workers in the salon industry and works to standardize safe, pollution prevention salon practices that can be implemented nationwide and globally. The Program focuses on the reduction of carcinogenic and reproductive toxins in the workplace by establishing locally-legislated programs that educate and empower salon employees and incentivize salons to reduce chemical exposures and protect the health of the employees, customers, and the environment.Nail salon workers handle products containing toxic chemicals, solvents, and volatile organic compounds known to be harmful to human and environmental health, but there is very little federal and state oversight of chemical use and exposure in salons. The workers and salon owners often lack accurate information about safe occupational practices and hazardous waste disposal policies that impact thousands of individuals and pollute air and water.In the United States, over 400,000 individuals are formally employed in the nail salon sector, excluding the thousands of independent contractors who rent stations in salons. Over 97 percent of salon workers in the U.S. are women, many of them immigrants. In California alone, it is estimated that up to 80 percent of manicurists and cosmetologists are Vietnamese immigrants, and more than 50 percent are of reproductive age. The California Healthy Nail Salon Collaborative and AHS partnered with the City and County of San Francisco, the City of Santa Monica, Alameda County, Santa Clara County, and San Mateo County to standardize safe, pollution prevention practices by requiring that to qualify as a \"Healthy Nail Salon,\" a salon must 1) use products free of chemicals known to cause reproductive harm, cancer and respiratory problems; and 2) train workers in the best practices for worker safety and environmental health. As of July 2016, 96 salons carry the \"Healthy Nail Salon\" seal.The Collaborative, AHS, and its partners are taking the lead on the issue of environmental justice in the nail salon industry with a high level of progress and partnership. By fostering partnerships on several levels\u2014individual (salon workers), community (organizations and groups), local (counties, cities, policymakers), and national (federal and government agencies)\u2014the Collaborative has brought together diverse entities to implement an innovative and growing program, and in the process, has brought national attention to salon worker environmental justice, health, safety, and rights.Building on the success of the Healthy Nail Salon Recognition Programs at the city and county level, on September 24, Governor Jerry Brown signed California Assembly Bill 2125, requiring the California Department of Toxic Substances Control to create guidelines for local governments to voluntarily implement Healthy Nail Salon Recognition programs.\"The Roy Award selection committee was especially impressed with the program's commitment to empowering salon workers to proactively take steps to improve their health and safety and reduce chemical exposure in their workplaces and communities,\" said Henry Lee, director of the Environment and Natural Resources program at Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, which coordinates the award. \"We believe that this partnership demonstrates the impact of a highly-local, targeted approach in addressing environmental health and justice \u2013 and one that can be replicated around the globe.\" The partnership was selected from a number of highly qualified projects the world that tackle tough environmental problems ranging from eliminating lead in gasoline to lessening the environmental impacts of textile manufacturing to harnessing big data to protect forests. Experts world-wide reviewed the nominated projects with the following criteria: innovation, effectiveness, significance, and transferability.\u00a0\"It is a great honor that our diverse partnership of non-profit and governmental partners, who have come together to address what has been an overlooked environmental justice issue in our nation, are being recognized for their cross-sector collaborative efforts,\" said Julia Liou, Planning and Development Director at  and Co-Founder of the .The purpose of the Roy Family Award for Environmental Partnership is to draw attention to an exceptional partnership and its achievements while inspiring others to replicate or expand upon its success. \"We are delighted to receive this award along with the Healthy Nail Salon Collaborative,\" said Debbie Raphael, director of the. \"It acknowledges fruitful collaboration among government, NGOs and small business to make work environments healthier. Despite these gains, federal law regarding cosmetics is woefully weak and we call on Congress to strengthen FDA's ability to regulate personal care products and professional salon products.\"Belfer Center CoverageWatch a panel held at the Harvard Kennedy School,  discuss the California Healthy Nail Salon CollaborativeExternal CoverageCoverage in the Harvard National coverage by Local coverage in the<br /><br />2013: Dow-TNC Collaboration<br /><br />The Dow-TNC Collaboration is an innovative partnership between The Dow Chemical Company and The Nature Conservancy to research the value of ecosystem services. Established in 2011, the five-year project combines the expertise of Dow, one of the world\u2019s largest chemical manufacturers, and TNC, the foremost global land and water conservation organization, to develop tools and models that incorporate the value of resources provided by nature into business decisions.Ecosystems provide valuable services for communities and companies. Measuring the value of water, land, air, oceans, plants, and animals to a company or community is difficult, and as a result, business decisions are often made without taking natural assets into account. The Dow-TNC collaboration takes a science-based, measurable approach to help companies understand how to incorporate the value of nature into the business decision process. The ecosystem services framework has long been hailed by academics as a viable mechanism for valuing nature, but has not been practically applied \u2013 until now.In January 2011, Dow and TNC launched their 5-year collaboration to promote valuing ecosystem services in business decision-making. Since the launch, Dow and TNC have worked together to identify key ecosystem services that Dow relies upon as well as the environmental impacts of priority Dow manufacturing sites around the world. Scientists from TNC and Dow are working together at selected Dow pilot sites to implement and refine models that support corporate decision-making by taking into consideration the value and resources that ecosystem services provide. These sites serve as \u201cliving laboratories\u201d where Dow and TNC are testing methods and models of ecosystem valuation so they can be used to inform more sustainable business decisions at Dow and influence the decision-making and business practices of other companies globally.The collaboration recently completed its first pilot at Dow\u2019s facility in Freeport, Texas, the company\u2019s largest manufacturing facility; and is currently in the midst of the second pilot in Santa Vitoria, Brazil. A major goal of this collaboration is to produce results and findings that are replicable and transferable to Dow\u2019s other 135 sites. In addition, most of the methodologies, tools and results will be shared publicly with the hope that other companies, non-governmental organizations and governments can make use of them as well.\u201cValuing natural services is a critical step in protecting our environment \u2013 and one that should be replicated around the globe,\u201d said Henry Lee, director of the Environment and Natural Resources program at Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, in announcing the 2013 award winner.Neil Hawkins, vice president of Global EH&amp;S and Sustainability at Dow, said \u201cThis award is recognition not only of this unique collaboration, but truly a win for sustainable business. We hope to incorporate the value of nature into decision-making \u2013 not only at Dow but also across the broader business community, inspiring others to invest in nature as well.\u201d\u201cOur collaboration shows how companies and public-interest organizations can work together to make economic growth a force for conservation,\" said Glenn Prickett, chief external affairs officer for The Nature Conservancy. \u00a0\u201cBy studying the value of nature and incorporating it in business decisions, the private sector can become a powerful agent not only for economic development, but for conserving the healthy lands and waters on which our economy depends.\u201dBelfer Center CoverageExternal Coverage<br /><br />2011: Refrigerants, Naturally!<br /><br />In 2011, ENRP awarded the Roy Family Award to Refrigerants, Naturally!, a\u00a0 unique global initiative of companies committed to combating climate change and ozone layer depletion by substituting harmful fluorinated gases (\"F-gases\", such as CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs) with natural refrigerants.Since Refrigerants, Naturally! received the Roy Family Award for Environmental Partnership in 2011, the partners have continued their efforts to provide HFC-free cooling equipment in Europe, the US, and around the world. Unilever, for example, has rolled out more than one million HFC-free ice cream cabinets. Coca Cola remains committed to their goal of going HFC-free in all new equipment by 2015 and at the London Olympics already every single one of Coca Cola\u2019s 3,130 vending and cooling units are HFC-free, most of them using CO2 technology.In February 2012, the US Environmental Protection Agency finally included hydrocarbon refrigerants such as propane and isobutane in their list of substitutes for ozone-depleting substances in household refrigerators and freezers \u2013 a decision Refrigerants, Naturally! had long been hoping and advocating for. Hydrocarbon refrigerants have zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) and very low global warming potential (GWP) compared to other refrigerants.Partner companies are Unilever, McDonald\u2019s, The Coca Cola Company, Pepsico, and Red Bull, which joined in 2011. UNEP and Greenpeace are supporting partners. Several companies have expressed interest in committing to an HFC-free future and participating in the partnership. The members are optimistic that their number will continue to grow.In November 2010, the Board of the Consumer Goods Forum has agreed on a resolution and action plan to mobilize resources within their respective\u00a0 businesses to begin phasing out HFC refrigerants by 2015, and replace them with non-HFC refrigerants (natural refrigerant alternatives) where these are legally allowed and available for new purchases of point-of-sale units and large refrigeration installations. Since then, the CGF Member companies have made steady progress. To help deliver continued momentum in fulfilment of the Board Refrigeration resolution, the 2nd CGF Sustainable Refrigeration Summit was held in Atlanta on September 28th 2011. At the Summit were 110 attendees, representing equipment suppliers, retailers, other CPG companies, customers, and NGO partners. A total of 45 companies representing geographical diversity (Asia, North America, Europe, and Latin America) were in attendance. At this summit, they identified common challenges to implementing this commitment and discussed ways to overcome these challenges.Individuals in photo from left to right: Else Krueck (Director Environment &amp; CSR, McDonald's Europe), Bernard Morauw (Senior Director of Worldwide Equipment, McDonald\u2019s), Emad Jafa (Pepsico), Bob Langert (Vice President for Corporate Social Responsibility, McDonald\u2019s), Professor Henry Lee (HKS), Antoine Azar (Global Program Manager, The Coca Cola Company), Amy Larkin (Director, Greenpeace Solutions), Rajendra Shende (Head of OzonAction, United Nations Environment Programme),\u00a0David Lustig (Vice President for Global External Affairs, Unilever), Bryan Jacob (Director of Energy Management &amp; Climate Protection, The Coca Cola Company), Jeff Seabright (Vice President for Environment and Water Resources, The Coca-Cola Company), Ellen Roy Hertzfelder (Representative of the Roy family)Individuals in photo from left to right: Professor Henry Lee (HKS), Amy Larkin (Director, Greenpeace Solutions), David Lustig (Vice President for External Affairs, Unilever), Jeff Seabright (The Coca-Cola Company), Rajendra Shende (United Nations Environment Programme), Ellen Roy Hertzfelder (Representative of the Roy family)Belfer Center CoverageExternal Coverage<br /><br />2009: Mexico City Metrobus<br /><br />In 2009, the Roy Family Award was given to the Mexico City Metrobus, a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system that reduces air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, while improving the quality of life and transportation options in one of the largest cities in the world. The Metrobus system is a result of a partnership launched by EMBARQ - The World Resources Institute Center for Sustainable Transport - with assistance from CEIBA (a Mexican NGO) and the Mexico City government and with funding and support from the Shell Foundation, Caterpillar Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, and the World Bank. Through this collaboration, EMBARQ, CEIBA and Mexico City established the Center for Sustainable Transport in Mexico, now known as EMBARQ Mexico, the not-for-profit organization that has provided ongoing technical assistance to the Metrobus system from its inception through its expansion.The Metrobus system has expanded rapidly in recent years, from 20 kilometers in 2005 to 95 kilometers in 2012. In April 2012, the system expanded even further: it opened Line 4, which runs through the historic downtown neighborhood of the city and extends to the airport. As of 2012, the Metrobus system served 760,000 passengers per day.Individuals in photo from left to right: Professor Henry Lee (HKS), Alexis Mariani (Sr. Climate Change Specialist, Global Environment Facility), Ellen Roy Hertzfelder (Representative of the Roy family), Nancy Kete (Director, EMBARQ \u2013 The World Resources Institute Center for Sustainable Transportation), Adriana Lobo (Executive Director, Center for Sustainable Transport in Mexico), Chris West (Director, Shell Foundation), Dean David Ellwood (HKS), Marcelo Ebrard (Mayor of Mexico City), Alejandro Villegas (Program Officer, Hewlett Foundation), Guillermo Calderon (Director General for the Metrobus)Individuals in photo from left to right: Marcelo Ebrard (Mayor of Mexico City), Dean David Ellwood (HKS)Belfer Center CoverageExternal CoverageArticles in Spanish<br /><br />2007: Hybrid Systems for Rural Electrification in Africa<br /><br />In 2007, ENRP awarded the Roy Family Award to the Hybrid Systems for Rural Electrification in Africa (HSREA), a collaboration among Energiebau Solarstromsysteme, a German solartechnology provider; InWEnt- Capacity Building International, Germany, a non-profit organization with expertise in human resources development, and their African colleagues at Kakute Limited, a technology training company in Tanzania; RENERG Ghana; and the Vincentian Sisters in Mbinga, Tanzania. The HSREA Project provides reliable, renewable electricity to rural African villages through a system of solar panel technology combined with modified diesel motors running on pure plant oil from the plentiful jatropha nut.After being awarded with the Roy Family Award 2007, the project team composed of InWEnt \u2013 Capacity Building International, Germany (now: GIZ - Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH) and Energiebau Solarstromsysteme, Cologne/Germany together with its main partner Kakute Ltd. Arusha/Tanzania intensified the capacity building activities in Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania.It implemented training courses in Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania to enhance the local capacities for optimized jatropha cultivation. As part of the regional outreach, a special training in Tanzania was also offered for experts from Ethiopia. Besides this, two motor trainings for multi-fuel generators were carried out in Cologne/Germany to ensure proper operation of the installed hybrid-systems.In order to underpin the relevance of jatropha in general and specially of hybrid-systems combining photovoltaic systems with refitted generators running on straight vegetable oil from the jatropha nuts, a regional \u201cDialogue Forum on Biofuels for Poverty Alleviation\u201d was carried out in December 2008 in cooperation with UNEP-DTIE and FAO, bringing together representatives from the relevant ministries for rural and social development, research institutes and NGOs from Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Ruanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. The reason for focusing poverty alleviation on the political level was that more and more African countries were confronted with an international hype caused by the search for alternatives to fossil fuels. They experienced increasing pressure to convert arable land into plantations for export-oriented production of oil seeds \u2013 among others jatropha \u2013 without having defined their own biofuel policies. The forum therefore came up with recommendations on how to shape such policies.Under such circumstances, the approach to use straight vegetable jatropha oil for fueling off-grid power systems in rural areas is still innovative but has also to compete with diesel generators that are cheaper in the short run than hybrid-systems, but are inefficient and extend the dependence on fossil fuels.A promising program is now developed in Zimbabwe using the HSREA approach and its network: The NGO Environment Africa is engaged in a project working on three pillars: policy development, research and, community development. The aim of the last is to assist community groups in setting up small businesses on processing of the seed for production of oil for soap making and energy. This also involves setting up a hybrid system. Two oil milling plants in Mudzi and Mutoko districts have been developed yet. The installation of the hybrid-system is scheduled for next year.Individuals in photo from left to right \u2013 Back Row: Marko Schmitt (Projects Worldwide, Energiebau), Bernd Wolff (Project Manager, Energiebau), Michael Funcke-Bartz (Senior Project Manager, InWent, Achim Steiner (Executive Director, United Nations Environment Programme), Bernd Schleich (Managing Director, InWent)Front Row: Livinus Manyanga (Director, Kakute, Ltd.

The Noel Kempff Mercado National Park is located in one of the few areas in South America where several different ecosystems converge: the evergreen forest of the highlands, the cerrado\u2019s savannas, the savanna\u2019s wetlands, and the forest\u2019s wetlands.\u00a0 In 1997, when 832,000 hectares of tropical forest adjacent to the park were threatened with timber harvesting and deforestation, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and Bolivian conservation organization Fundaci\u00f3n Amigos de la Naturaleza (FAN) created the NK-CAP. Together with the Bolivian government and three energy companies, the partners terminated the logging rights and the land was incorporated into the national park. Then the project partners launched a rigorous scientific program to measure the carbon stored in the project area and the carbon emissions avoided by the project.In its 15 year existence, the Noel Kempff Climate Action Project has achieved the following results:It considerably expanded biodiversity protection in Bolivia.It preserved a rich and biologically diverse forest ecosystem.It was included in the UNESCO\u2019s list of World Heritage Sites.It avoided 1,034,107 tons CO2 emissions, which would have been caused by logging and deforestation between 1997 and 2005.It guaranteed the long-term projection of Noel Kempff Mercado National Park.It contributed substantially to the empowerment of the indigenous communities in Bajo Paragu\u00e1 and to community development, in particular.It supported indigenous communities to achieve legal status as \"Communities of Native Peoples\" and to apply for official recognition of their land title.It provided alternative, environmentally sustainable economic opportunities for the local population.In November 2005, an internationally accredited certifier evaluated and certified the Noel Kempff Climate Action Project design and its emissions reductions. It was the first forest emissions reductions project to be fully certified using rigorous standards based on those used in the Clean Development Mechanism. The Noel Kempff project provided an excellent working example of how carbon sequestered in the living biomass of forests, and emissions reductions achieved through forest conservation, can be scientifically quantified, monitored and certified, and also generate benefits for biodiversity and local communities.Due to the current position of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, which is opposed to carbon markets, the project is analyzing opportunities and scenarios to adjust to the Bolivian policies regarding the climate change regime, and to continue generating benefits to biodiversity conservation and local communities in the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park.Belfer Center CoverageExternal Coverage<br /><br />For More Information<br /><br />StaffAssociate Director, Environment and Natural Resources Program<br /><br />Expertise:ENRP offers several funding opportunities for Harvard Kennedy School (HKS) and Harvard College students.

The Roy Award is presented every two years to celebrate outstanding public-private partnership projects that enhance environmental quality through novel and creative approaches. Since 2003, the Roy Award has recognized eight winning partnerships and has engaged with many more finalists and nominees during our rigorous evaluation process.The Roy Award nominations are evaluated with the following criteria: Innovation, Effectiveness, Transferability, and Significance. Effectiveness is measured by determining if and how the project has made demonstrable, concrete progress towards achieving its goals, and how the goals contribute to solving an environmental problem. The partnership is evaluated on its actual results achieved to date and the potential results if the project\u2019s approach is widely adopted.The overall objective of the international project is to develop a new research agenda, which is both of theoretical importance for understanding complex governance systems and of pressing policy significance for sustainable development, and will allow us to answer questions like:How effective are public-private partnerships in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals?How can we conceptualize and operationalize the effectiveness of partnerships? Through what mechanisms are partnerships\u2019 effects likely to materialize?And specifically, ENRP\u2019s contribution will allow us to explore the following:What are the attributes that contribute to the success or failure of partnerships?How have the structure and approach of partnerships changed over time?<br /><br />Featured People<br /><br />StaffAssociate Director, Environment and Natural Resources Program<br /><br />Expertise:FellowFellow, Environment and Natural Resources Program<br /><br />Expertise:For More Information<br /><br />AlumniStaff Assistant, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs<br /><br />Belfer Center Email Updates<br /><br />Social Media<br /><br />Research, ideas, and leadership for a more secure, peaceful world.<br /><br />79 John F.

Transatlantic Policies to Sustain the West<br /><br />The transatlantic area is the core of the West. As such, we will address how to roll back the rising tide of populism on both sides of the Atlantic and help to make transatlantic values tangible to citizens on both sides to of the Atlantic. Teaching, research, and events in this area will address the increase in anti-democratic forces in Europe, the future of work and education in the 21st century, the challenge of digitalization, and active measures to strengthen democracy and social cohesion in the United States and across Europe.<br /><br />II. Transatlantic Security Relations<br /><br />We will examine the future of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in a changing threat environment and maps the path forward for closer integration of the EU and NATO on defense-related matters. It will highlight new opportunities to jointly tackle hybrid warfare, cybersecurity, intelligence cooperation and the fight against global terrorism. In collaboration with colleagues from other programs across the Belfer Center, it will also explore the relationship with Europe\u2019s largest neighbor, Russia. On the 70th Anniversary of NATO in early 2019, it will issue a report on the organization\u2019s future, co-authored by the Project\u2019s Faculty Chair, Nicholas Burns, and its Senior Fellow, Douglas Lute, both former US Permanent Representatives to NATO.<br /><br />III. Transatlantic Diplomacy on Global Issues<br /><br />Transatlantic diplomatic collaboration between the U.S. and the European Union on transnational issues, including on the prevention of climate change, the prevention of terrorism, the spread of pandemic disease and migration and refugee policy, are key issues. Study groups, seminars and teaching will also examine the ability of existing institutional systems on both sides of the Atlantic to cope with a plethora of new diplomatic challenges and to develop the capacities toward more effective diplomacy on both sides of the Atlantic. It will examine areas of collaboration between the U.S. National Security Strategy and the EU Global Strategy.<br /><br />IV. Transatlantic Economic Relations<br /><br />We will look at the future of the trade relationship between the United States and the European Union, as well as the United Kingdom after Brexit. Energy policy and business and industrial relations will also be addressed as part of this work stream. In collaboration with the School\u2019s Klein Fellowship program, we look forward to welcoming to Harvard leading economic policy makers, after the visit of IMF Managing Director, Christine Lagarde, in autumn of 2017.<br /><br />ActivitiesTeaching and Research on Europe and the Transatlantic RelationshipThe Project on Europe and the Transatlantic Relationship supports teaching and research in these four issues areas.

Teaching, research, and events in this area will address the increase in anti-democratic forces in Europe, the future of work and education in the 21st century, the challenge of digitalization, and active measures to strengthen democracy and social cohesion in the United States and across Europe.<br /><br />II. Transatlantic Security Relations<br /><br />We will examine the future of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in a changing threat environment and maps the path forward for closer integration of the EU and NATO on defense-related matters. It will highlight new opportunities to jointly tackle hybrid warfare, cybersecurity, intelligence cooperation and the fight against global terrorism. In collaboration with colleagues from other programs across the Belfer Center, it will also explore the relationship with Europe\u2019s largest neighbor, Russia. On the 70th Anniversary of NATO in early 2019, it will issue a report on the organization\u2019s future, co-authored by the Project\u2019s Faculty Chair, Nicholas Burns, and its Senior Fellow, Douglas Lute, both former US Permanent Representatives to NATO.<br /><br />III. Transatlantic Diplomacy on Global Issues<br /><br />Transatlantic diplomatic collaboration between the U.S. and the European Union on transnational issues, including on the prevention of climate change, the prevention of terrorism, the spread of pandemic disease and migration and refugee policy, are key issues. Study groups, seminars and teaching will also examine the ability of existing institutional systems on both sides of the Atlantic to cope with a plethora of new diplomatic challenges and to develop the capacities toward more effective diplomacy on both sides of the Atlantic. It will examine areas of collaboration between the U.S. National Security Strategy and the EU Global Strategy.<br /><br />IV. Transatlantic Economic Relations<br /><br />We will look at the future of the trade relationship between the United States and the European Union, as well as the United Kingdom after Brexit. Energy policy and business and industrial relations will also be addressed as part of this work stream. In collaboration with the School\u2019s Klein Fellowship program, we look forward to welcoming to Harvard leading economic policy makers, after the visit of IMF Managing Director, Christine Lagarde, in autumn of 2017.<br /><br />ActivitiesTeaching and Research on Europe and the Transatlantic RelationshipThe Project on Europe and the Transatlantic Relationship supports teaching and research in these four issues areas.

Our goal is to develop and promote policies that expand the contribution of science and technology to human welfare.<br /><br />AboutThe Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program (STPP) is a research, teaching, and outreach program of the Belfer Center for Science\u00a0and International Affairs. Solutions to many of the world's most challenging problems involve complex scientific and technological issues.\u00a0Good policy making in these areas requires access to the frontier of scientific knowledge, not simply to translate scientific information, but to bring an appreciation for the potential and the limitations of scientific understanding, blending scientific insights with those from other relevant disciplines including economics and politics.\u00a0From the nuclear negotiations with Iran to privacy concerns about big data, current events remind us how scientific knowledge has become essential to good policy making, whether at local, national, or international scales.Bringing science and technology into the design of public policy has been the tradition and the objective of the Program on Science, Technology, and Public Policy (STPP) at Harvard Kennedy School for nearly four decades.\u00a0 Founded by the late Harvey Brooks, STPP has earned an international reputation for integrating scientific expertise with practical experience in politics and policy.\u00a0Past leaders of the program, including John Holdren, science advisor to President Obama, and Venkatesh Narayanamurti, former dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, have developed research groups focused on critical issues of national security, energy, and climate, including nuclear proliferation and energy technology innovation.\u00a0 Under the new direction of Dan Schrag, STPP continues to contribute to the unique role that Harvard Kennedy School plays in the broader university, \"training public leaders, and generating ideas that provide solutions to our most challenging public problems.\"<br /><br />Directors'\u00a0Message\"Science is more essential for our prosperity, our security, our health, our environment, and our quality of life than it has ever been before\u2026 {and] many of the challenges that science and technology will help us meet are global in character\"President Barack Obama's speech to the Speech to the National Academy of Sciences, April 27, 2009.STPP VisionThe science and technology (S&amp;T) enterprise is increasingly central to global transformations and developments; S&amp;T policy, in turn, by virtue of its key role in guiding and managing this enterprise, is also gaining in importance.\u00a0From\u00a0climate change\u00a0to renewable energy, from broadband policy to cybersecurity, science and technology permeates all of society and everyday life, often playing a central, even essential role in almost every aspect.It is therefore critical to understand how we may be able to best realize the potential of science and technology in improving the human condition, underpinning economic and social development, supporting human endeavors, and promoting international relations, being cognizant of and addressing societal concerns that often accompany such advances.Public policy plays a central role in mediating this interface between science and technology and society. Among its most potent impacts, policy shapes innovation \u2014 and is therefore the key to society translating knowledge into technologies and products that benefit all, in time. In today's globalized world, innovation can be swift and its possibilities rich; in the digital world innovation is at once in the hands of many, yet still complex and involving many actors and institutions. Public policy has a particularly important role to play shaping these relations,\u00a0supporting and catalyzing research, and accelerating diffusion by many paths. As our networked world is already transforming these dynamics, gaining rapid insight to trends in technology and innovation as they unfold, and how public policy\u00a0may affect them positively is critical\u00a0to\u00a0contributing to the challenges of our times.The Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program (STPP) aims to be the premier global academic center in these matters.\u00a0STPP takes as its mission to examine and shape the conduct of the S&amp;T enterprise, its interactions with societies and economies worldwide, and the role of public policy in strengthening this enterprise and its contribution to human well-being. STPP helps advance knowledge about the role of public policy in the S&amp;T enterprise and develops and promotes policies that enhance its positive global impact.STPP StrategyThe nature of STPP requires its scholarship to be integrative and interdisciplinary.\u00a0Accordingly, the Program engages in research, teaching, and outreach on how:science and technology influence public policy;public policy influences the evolution of science and technology;the outcomes of these interactions affect well-being in the United States and worldwide;the processes involved can be made more effective and their outcomes more beneficialThe cross-disciplinary nature of the S&amp;T enterprise requires that STPP research initiatives be collaborative. We therefore prize collaborations and partnerships with faculty across Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard University, and other institutions. Our core activities center around four thematic areas where public policy and innovation play an important role, with a view that includes their global implications:S&amp;T, Energy, and Environment: Access to energy underpins human and economic development, while access to a clean environment is critical for human well-being.\u00a0 Energy and environment are also intimately inter-linked, given the large impact of energy extraction, conversion, and use on the environment.\u00a0Key issues of interest include the study of the processes of technological innovation in the fields of energy and environment and the design of policies and institutions can shape and accelerate the development and deployment of technologies to promote energy access and energy security, to mitigate, adapt and reduce vulnerability to climate change, and to reduce other environmental and health impacts from industrial activities.S&amp;T and International Security: Technology is an integral part of the international security arena, both by virtue of its role in weapons systems as well as monitoring of programs and activities, whether as part of a compliance regime under international treaties or for general observation.\u00a0Areas of focus include the disposition and management of nuclear materials, nuclear weapons programs, nuclear energy, arms-control treaties and programs, technology and terrorism, military technologies, and weaponization of space.Information and Communications Technology (ICT)\u00a0&amp; Innovation: ICTs are transforming almost every aspect of our day-to-day lives, thereby opening up opportunities for positive contributions to society.\u00a0 Studies in this area will include assessing the potential for new forms of civic engagement and the governance of democratic institutions enabled by ICT; understanding how new media tools and ICT-enabled social media will shape the next waves of enterprise change; understanding issues in ICT-enabled reforms and redesign of top-down production to network-enabled collaboration and governance; fostering the transition to digital technologies in the developing world where ICTs\u00a0may accelerate improvements in health, prosperity, and security; understanding the roles and potential impacts of new and emerging information and communications technologies on our great challenges; issues in securing the nation's cyber infrastructure while maintaining the free flow of information in an open society; and contemporary issues in the use and regulation of telecommunications, the Internet and the emerging national broadband plan.Globalization, Development, &amp; Innovation: The interactions between technological innovation and globalization have profound implications for developing countries. Advances in science and technology, for example, offer new tools to promote sustainable development and put sectors such as agriculture at the center of efforts to spur economic development. How best to align science and technology missions with regional development goals and promote economic integration? How can \"green growth\" strategies that focus on eco-efficiency promote cross-border collaboration and economic development? Through research, training, and policy analysis, articulation of such issues can promote the diffusion of scientific and technological\u00a0 knowledge, promote wise investment, help develop technical expertise, foster entrepreneurial capabilities, and illuminate the path forward to economic transformation.<br /><br />Co-Directors<br /><br />Board of Directors<br /><br />FacultyTeresa and John Heinz Professor of Environmental Policy<br /><br />Co-Director, Science, Technology and Public Policy Program<br /><br />Member of the Board, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs<br /><br />President Obama&#039;s Science Advisor and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (January 2009 \u2013 January 2017)<br /><br />Expertise:Board of Directors<br /><br />FacultySteering Committee Member, Harvard Project on Climate Agreements<br /><br />Member of the Board, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs<br /><br />Co-Director, Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program<br /><br />Expertise:FacultyBoard of Directors<br /><br />FacultyProfessor of Practice; Co-Principal Investigator, Project on Managing the Atom<br /><br />Member of the Board, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs<br /><br />Expertise:Board of Directors<br /><br />FacultyMember of the Board, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs<br /><br />Faculty Chair, Environment and Natural Resources Program<br /><br />Harvey Brooks Professor of International Science, Public Policy, and Human Development<br /><br />Area Chair, HKS International and Global Affairs<br /><br />Expertise:FacultyLecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy School<br /><br />Faculty Lead, digital HKS<br /><br />Expertise:FacultyRaymond Plank Research Professor of Global Energy Policy<br /><br />Expertise:FacultyPforzheimer Professor of Science and Technology Studies<br /><br />Faculty Affiliate, Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program<br /><br />AlumniProfessor of the Practice of International Development; Director, Science, Technology, and Globalization Project; Principal Investigator, Agricultural Innovation in Africa<br /><br />Member of the Board, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs<br /><br />Expertise:FacultyProfessor of Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy School<br /><br />Expertise:Board of Directors<br /><br />FacultyDirector, Environment and Natural Resources Program<br /><br />Co-Principal Investigator, Energy Technology Innovation Policy<br /><br />Member of the Board, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs<br /><br />Senior Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy School<br /><br />Faculty Affiliate, Middle East Initiative<br /><br />Expertise:Board of Directors<br /><br />FacultyBenjamin Peirce Research Professor of Technology and Public Policy, Science, Technology, and Pubic Policy Program<br /><br />Member of the Board, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs<br /><br />Expertise:FacultyAdjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy School<br /><br />Expertise:Board of Directors<br /><br />FacultyDirector, Harvard Project on Climate Agreements<br /><br />A.J.

As a result, at this time NIST has no agenda of forthcoming influential scientific disseminations to post on its website in accordance with .<br /><br />NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY<br /><br />GUIDELINES, INFORMATION QUALITY STANDARDS, AND<br /><br />ADMINISTRATIVE MECHANISM<br /><br />PART I: BACKGROUND, MISSION, DEFINITIONS, AND SCOPE<br /><br />BACKGROUNDSection 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-554), hereinafter \"Section 515,\" directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue government-wide guidelines that \"provide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information (including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies.\" OMB complied by issuing guidelines which direct each Federal agency to (A) issue its own guidelines ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information disseminated by the agency; (B) establish administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain correction of information that does not comply with the OMB 515 Guidelines (Federal Register: February 22, 2002, Volume 67, Number 36, pp. 8452-8460, hereinafter \"OMB Guidelines\") and the agency guidelines; and (C) report periodically to the Director of OMB on the number and nature of complaints received by the agency regarding the accuracy of information disseminated by the agency and how such complaints were handled by the agency.<br /><br />In compliance with OMB directives, the Department of Commerce (DOC) has issued Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Disseminated Information ().<br /><br />This document implements Section 515 and fulfills the OMB and DOC information quality guidelines. It may be revised periodically, based on experience, evolving requirements in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and concerns expressed by the public. Covered information disseminated by NIST will comply with all applicable OMB, DOC, and NIST Information Quality Guidelines and Standards. NIST is committed to maintaining a high level of quality in the information it disseminates.<br /><br />In implementing these guidelines and standards, NIST acknowledges that ensuring the quality of information is an important management objective that takes its place alongside other NIST objectives, such as ensuring the success of the NIST mission, observing budget and resource priorities and restraints, and providing useful information to the public. NIST intends to implement these guidelines and standards in a way that will achieve all these objectives in a harmonious way.<br /><br />MISSIONNIST's mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.<br /><br />DEFINITIONS<br /><br />The definitions in this section apply throughout these Guidelines and Standards.<br /><br />Quality is an encompassing term comprising utility, objectivity, and integrity. Therefore, the guidelines sometimes refer to these four statutory terms, collectively, as \"quality.\"<br /><br />Utility refers to the usefulness of the information to its intended users, including the public. In assessing the usefulness of information that the agency disseminates to the public, NIST considers the uses of the information not only from its own perspective but also from the perspective of the public. As a result, when transparency of information is relevant for assessing the information's usefulness from the public's perspective, NIST takes care to ensure that transparency has been addressed in its review of the information.<br /><br />Objectivity consists of two distinct elements: presentation and substance. The presentation element includes whether disseminated information is presented in an accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased manner and in a proper context. The substance element involves a focus on ensuring accurate, reliable, and unbiased information. In a scientific, financial, or statistical context, the original and supporting data will be generated, and the analytic results will be developed, using sound statistical and research methods.<br /><br />Integrity refers to security \u2013 the protection of information from unauthorized access or revision, to ensure that the information is not compromised through corruption or falsification.<br /><br />Information means any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts or data, in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual forms. This definition includes information that an agency disseminates from a Web page, but does not include the provision of hyperlinks to information that others disseminate. This definition does not include opinions, where the agency's presentation makes it clear that what is being offered is someone's opinion rather than fact or the agency's views.<br /><br />Government information means information created, collected, processed, disseminated, or disposed of by or for the Federal Government.<br /><br />Information dissemination product means any books, paper, map, machine-readable material, audiovisual production, or other documentary material, regardless of physical form or characteristic, an agency disseminates to the public. This definition includes any electronic document, CD-ROM, or Web page.<br /><br />Dissemination means agency initiated or sponsored distribution of information to the public. Dissemination does not include distribution limited to government employees or agency contractors or grantees; intra- or inter-agency use or sharing of government information; and responses to requests for agency records under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Federal Advisory Committee Act or other similar law. This definition also does not include distribution limited to correspondence with individuals or persons, press releases, archival records, public filings, subpoenas or adjudicative processes.<br /><br />Agency initiated distribution of information to the public refers to information that the Agency distributes or releases which reflects, represents, or forms any part of the support of the policies of the Agency. In addition, if the Agency, as an institution, distributes or releases information prepared by an outside party in a manner that reasonably suggests that the Agency agrees with the information, this would be considered Agency initiated distribution and hence Agency dissemination because of the appearance of having the information represent Agency views.<br /><br />Agency sponsored distribution of information to the public refers to situations where the Agency has directed a third party to distribute or release information, or where the Agency has the authority to review and approve the information before release. By contrast, if the Agency simply provides funding to support research, and if the researcher (not the Agency) decides whether to distribute the results and - if the results are to be released - determines the content and presentation of the distribution, then the Agency has not \"sponsored\" the dissemination even though it has funded the research and even if the Agency retains ownership or other intellectual property rights because the Federal government paid for the research.<br /><br />Influential, when used in the phrase \"influential scientific, financial, or statistical information,'' means that the agency can reasonably determine that dissemination of the information will have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policy and private sector decisions.<br /><br />Scientific information means factual inputs, data, models, analyses, technical information, or scientific assessments based on the behavioral and social sciences, public health and medical sciences, life and earth sciences, engineering, or physical sciences. This includes any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts or data, in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative or audiovisual forms that involves a field identified in the preceding sentence. This definition includes scientific information that an agency disseminates from a web page, but does not include the provision of hyperlinks to scientific information that others disseminate. This definition does not include opinions, where the agency's presentation makes clear that what is being offered is someone's opinion rather than fact or the agency's views.<br /><br />Influential scientific information means scientific information the agency reasonably can determine will have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or private sector decisions.<br /><br />Scientific assessment means an evaluation of a body of scientific or technical knowledge, which typically synthesizes multiple factual inputs, data, models, assumptions, and/or applies best professional judgment to bridge uncertainties in the available information. These assessments include, but are not limited to, state of science reports; technology assessments; weight of evidence analyses; meta analyses; health, safety, or ecological risk assessments; toxicological characterizations of substances; integrated assessment models; hazard determinations; or exposure assessments.<br /><br />The term highly influential scientific assessment means influential scientific information that the agency or the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget determines to be a scientific assessment that: (i) could have a potential impact of more than $500 million in any year, or (ii) is novel, controversial, or precedent setting or has significant interagency interest.<br /><br />Reproducibility means that the information is capable of being substantially reproduced, subject to an acceptable degree of imprecision. For information judged to have more (less) important impacts, the degree of imprecision that is tolerated is reduced (increased). With respect to analytic results, \"capable of being substantially reproduced'' means that independent analysis of the original or supporting data using identical methods would generate similar analytic results, subject to an acceptable degree of imprecision or error.<br /><br />Transparency is not defined in the OMB Guidelines, but the Supplementary Information to the OMB Guidelines indicates (p. 8456) that \"transparency\" is at the heart of the reproducibility standard. The Guidelines state that \"The purpose of the reproducibility standard is to cultivate a consistent agency commitment to transparency about how analytic results are generated: the specific data used, the various assumptions employed, the specific analytic methods applied, and the statistical procedures employed. If sufficient transparency is achieved on each of these matters, then an analytic result should meet the reproducibility standard.\" In others words, transparency \u2013 and ultimately reproducibility \u2013 is a matter of showing how you got the results being disseminated.<br /><br />SCOPEThese guidelines cover information disseminated by NIST on or after October 1, 2002, regardless of when the information was first disseminated, except that pre-dissemination review procedures shall apply only to information first disseminated on or after October 1, 2002.<br /><br />Information Disseminated by NIST and Covered by these Guidelines and StandardsCorporate or general information includes all non-scientific, non-financial, non-statistical information. NIST disseminates many types of non-scientific, non-financial, non-statistical information, including but not limited to:<br /><br />Non-scientific training materials;<br /><br />Catalogs for NIST products and services;<br /><br />Descriptive programmatic information, including brochures, pamphlets, newsletters, fact sheets, and website descriptions;<br /><br />NIST Laboratory and Division annual reports;<br /><br />Directories;<br /><br />Program handbooks, manuals, and guidelines;<br /><br />NIST impacts by state;<br /><br />Conference information;<br /><br />Job opportunities;<br /><br />NIST videos; and<br /><br />Lists of accredited laboratories and validated products.<br /><br />Scientific, financial, and statistical information includes all scientific, financial, and statistical information disseminated by NIST. NIST disseminates scientific and financial information to the public in a variety of formats, including but not limited to data, databases, standard reference materials, scientific papers, economic impact studies, technical talks and presentations, exhibits, and web sites.<br /><br />Information quality is an integral part of the pre-dissemination review of information disseminated by NIST. Information quality is also integral to information collections conducted by NIST, and is incorporated into the clearance process required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) to help improve the quality of information that NIST collects and disseminates to the public. NIST programs already are required to demonstrate in their PRA submissions to OMB the utility of a proposed collection of information that they plan to disseminate. Additionally, for all proposed collections of information that will be disseminated to the public, NIST programs should demonstrate in their PRA clearance submissions to OMB that the proposed collection of information will result in information that will be collected, maintained, and used in a way consistent with applicable information quality guidelines and standards.<br /><br />Information Not Covered by these Guidelines<br /><br />Information with distribution intended to be limited to government employees or agency contractors or grantees, including but not limited to the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Extranet Information for Center grantees.<br /><br />Information with distribution intended to be limited to intra- or inter-agency use or sharing of government information, including but not limited to programmatic performance, budget, human resources and strategic planning information submitted to the DOC.<br /><br />Responses to requests for agency records under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Federal Advisory Committee Act or other similar law.<br /><br />Information relating solely to correspondence with individuals or persons, including but not limited to calibration reports, and Internal or Interagency Reports prepared and released to a single customer.<br /><br />Press releases, fact sheets, press conferences or similar communications in any medium that announce, support the announcement or give public notice of information NIST has disseminated elsewhere.<br /><br />Archival records, including library holdings.<br /><br />Archival information disseminated by NIST before October 1, 2002, and still maintained by NIST as archival material.<br /><br />Information presented to Congress as part of legislative or oversight processes, such as testimony of NIST officials, and information or drafting assistance provided to Congress in connection with proposed or pending legislation, that is not simultaneously disseminated to the public.<br /><br />Public filings.<br /><br />Subpoenas.Information limited to adjudicative processes, such as pleadings, including information developed during the conduct of any criminal or civil action or administrative enforcement action, investigation or audit against specific parties, or information distributed in documents limited to administrative action determining the rights and liabilities of specific parties under applicable statutes and regulations.<br /><br />Solicitations (e.g., program announcements, requests for proposals).<br /><br />Hyperlinks to information that others disseminate, as well as paper-based information from other sources referenced, but not approved or endorsed by NIST.<br /><br />Policy manuals and management information produced for the internal management and operations of NIST, and not primarily intended for public dissemination.<br /><br />Documents not authored by NIST and not intended to represent NIST's views, including information authored and distributed by NIST grantees, as long as the documents are not disseminated by NIST.<br /><br />Research data, findings, reports and other materials published or otherwise distributed by employees or by NIST contractors or grantees that are identified as not representing NIST views.<br /><br />Opinions where the presentation makes it clear that what is being offered is not the official view of NIST.<br /><br />Although information delivered to specific customers is not \"disseminated\" for purposes of these information quality standards, NIST's commitment to quality extends to this information. For example, NIST has entered into a Mutual Recognition Arrangement with the International Committee on Weights and Measures (CIPM), pursuant to which NIST has adopted a system for assuring quality in the results of measurements delivered to customers in calibration and measurement certificates.<br /><br />In addition, NIST releases software and algorithms. Some of this information is released as a service to the public, and the release of the information is not intended to imply NIST endorsement or adoption of the information. For this information, NIST will attach a disclaimer.<br /><br />PART II: INFORMATION QUALITY STANDARDS AND PRE-DISSEMINATION REVIEW<br /><br />Information quality is composed of three elements - utility, integrity and objectivity. Quality will be ensured and established at levels appropriate to the nature and timeliness of the information to be disseminated. Information quality is an integral part of the pre-dissemination review of information disseminated by NIST. Information quality is also integral to information collections conducted by NIST, and is incorporated into the clearance process required by the Paperwork Reduction Act.<br /><br />As OMB has recognized (OMB Guidelines, pp. 8452-8453), \"information quality comes at a cost.\" In this context, OMB directed that \"agencies should weigh the costs (for example, including costs attributable to agency processing effort, respondent burden, maintenance of needed privacy, and assurances of suitable confidentiality) and the benefits of higher information quality in the development of information, and the level of quality to which the information disseminated will be held.\" Therefore, in deciding the appropriate level of review and documentation for information disseminated by NIST, the costs and benefits of using a higher quality standard or a more extensive review process will be considered. Where necessary, other compelling interests such as privacy and confidentiality protections will be considered.<br /><br />The utility and integrity standards below pertain to all information disseminated by NIST. Following the utility and integrity standards are objectivity standards for each of the specific categories of NIST-disseminated information. Because most of the standards presented in this document reflect existing practice in NIST, the present tense has been used when describing them; but regardless of tense used, a performance standard is intended.<br /><br />UTILITYUtility means that disseminated information is useful to its intended users. \"Useful\" means that the content of the information is helpful, beneficial, or serviceable to its intended users, or that the information supports the usefulness of other disseminated information by making it more accessible or easier to read, see, understand, obtain, or use. Where the usefulness of information will be enhanced by greater transparency, care is taken that sufficient background and detail is available, either with the disseminated information or through other means, to maximize the usefulness of the information. The level of such background and detail is commensurate with the importance of the particular information, balanced against the resources required, and is appropriate to the nature and timeliness of the information to be disseminated.<br /><br />NIST's mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. NIST maintains ongoing contact with a broad spectrum of users through a variety of means, including but not limited to public meetings, public workshops, individual contacts, and formal and informal collaborations and partnerships, to ensure that the information it disseminates continues to remain relevant. NIST attends and holds public workshops, conferences, and meetings to gather input about what types of information would be useful to industry; universities; other not-for-profit entities; and Federal, state, and local governments; and maintains memberships in many industry groups for the purpose of facilitating such discussions.<br /><br />INTEGRITYPrior to dissemination, NIST information, independent of the specific intended distribution mechanism, is safeguarded from improper access, modification, or destruction, to a degree commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm that could result from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of such information.<br /><br />All electronic information disseminated by NIST adheres to the standards set out in Appendix III, \"Security of Automated Information Resources,\" OMB Circular A-130; the Computer Security Act, and the Government Information Systems Reform Act.<br /><br />Confidentiality of data collected by NIST is safeguarded under legislation such as the Privacy Act and Titles 13, 15, and 22 of the U.S. Code.<br /><br />OBJECTIVITY<br /><br />Objectivity ensures that information is accurate, reliable, and unbiased, and that information products are presented in an accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased manner. In a scientific, financial, or statistical context, the original and supporting data are generated, and the analytic results are developed, using sound statistical and research methods.<br /><br />Third-party Information. Third-party information from both domestic and international sources, such as states, municipalities, agencies and private entities may be included in information that NIST disseminates. Although third-party sources may not be directly subject to Section 515, information from such sources, when used by NIST to develop information products or to form the basis of a decision or policy, must be of known quality and consistent with the applicable information quality guidelines and standards. When such information is used, any limitations, assumptions, collection methods, or uncertainties concerning it are taken into account and disclosed.<br /><br />Corporate and General Information. Corporate and general information disseminated by NIST is presented in a clear, complete, and unbiased manner, and in a context that enhances usability to the intended audience. The sources of the disseminated information are identified to the extent possible, consistent with confidentiality, privacy, and security considerations and protections, and taking into account timely presentation, the medium of dissemination, and the importance of the information, balanced against the resources required and the time available.<br /><br />Information disseminated by NIST is reliable and accurate to an acceptable degree of error as determined by factors such as the importance of the information, its intended use, time sensitivity, expected degree of permanence, relation to the primary mission(s) of the disseminating office, and the context of the dissemination, balanced against the resources required and the time available. A body of information is considered to be reliable if experience shows it to be generally accurate. Accurate information, in the case of non-scientific, non-financial, non-statistical information, means information which is reasonably determined to be factually correct in the view of the disseminating office as of the time of dissemination.<br /><br />Review of corporate and general information disseminated by NIST is incorporated into the normal process of formulating the information to take advantage of inherent quality checks that are part of the process of formulating the information. This review is at a level appropriate to the information, taking into account the information's importance, balanced against the resources required and the time available. NIST treats information quality as integral to every step in its process of developing the information, including creation, collection, maintenance, and dissemination.<br /><br />Review can be accomplished in a number of ways, including but not limited to combinations of the following:<br /><br />Active personal review of information by supervisors and managers, either by reviewing each individual dissemination, or selected samples, or by any other reasonable method.<br /><br />Use of quality check lists, charts, statistics, or other means of tracking quality, completeness, and usefulness.<br /><br />Process design and monitoring to ensure that the process itself imposes checks on information quality.<br /><br />Peer monitoring during information preparation.<br /><br />Use of management controls.<br /><br />Review of comments from the public.<br /><br />Any other method which serves to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and objectivity of the information.<br /><br />Scientific, Financial, and Statistical Information. Scientific and financial information disseminated by NIST is presented in a clear, complete, and unbiased manner, and in a context which enhances usability to the intended audience. The sources of the disseminated information are identified to the extent possible, consistent with confidentiality, privacy, and security considerations and protections, and taking into account timely presentation, the medium of dissemination, and the importance of the information, balanced against the resources required and the time available.<br /><br />Scientific and financial information disseminated by NIST is reliable and accurate to an acceptable degree of error as determined by factors such as the importance of the information, its intended use, time sensitivity, expected degree of permanence, relation to the primary mission(s) of the disseminating office, and the context of the dissemination, balanced against the resources required and the time available. A body of information is considered to be reliable if experience shows it to be generally accurate. Accurate information, in the case of scientific and financial information, means information which is reasonably determined to be factually correct in the view of the disseminating office as of the time of dissemination.<br /><br />Influential, when used in the phrase \"influential scientific, financial, or statistical information,\" means that NIST can reasonably determine that dissemination of the information will have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or important private sector decisions.<br /><br />Preparation of Scientific Information<br /><br />Laboratory Notebooks: To appropriately document the preparation of scientific information, NIST maintains a policy regarding laboratory notebooks. NIST Laboratory staff engaged in measurement and in research and development activities are responsible for maintaining a thorough and accurate record of their work by keeping a laboratory or research notebook. Staff using electronic media for measurement, research, and development are responsible for maintaining a written notebook that chronologically documents the progress of their activity and indexes work files so that experimental data and results may be retrieved. The implementation of this policy provides transparency as to the sources of data and the methodologies used to prepare the information disseminated. It also provides the means for ensuring \"reproducibility\" as defined in the OMB guidelines:<br /><br />\"Reproducibility\" means that the information is capable of being substantially reproduced, subject to an acceptable degree of imprecision. For information judged to have more (less) important impacts, the degree of imprecision that is tolerated is reduced (increased). If agencies apply the reproducibility test to specific types of original or supporting data, the associate guidelines shall provide relevant definitions of reproducibility (e.g., standards for replication of laboratory data). With respect to analytic results, \"capable of being substantially reproduced\" means that independent analysis of the original or supporting data using identical methods would generate similar analytic results, subject to an acceptable degree of imprecision or error.<br /><br />Uncertainty Policy: NIST maintains a policy entitled \"Guidelines for Evaluating and Expressing the Uncertainty of NIST Measurement Results\" (NIST Technical Note 1297, 1994 Edition) (See .) The policy requires that NIST measurement results be accompanied by quantitative statements of their uncertainty, and that a uniform approach to expressing measurement uncertainty be followed. The policy applies to most NIST measurement results, including results associated with international comparisons of measurement standards, basic research, applied research and engineering, calibrating client measurement standards, certifying standard reference materials, and generating standard reference data. The implementation of this policy provides additional transparency as to the accuracy of the information disseminated.<br /><br />Pre-dissemination Review Process for Scientific Information<br /><br />The pre-dissemination review process enables NIST to substantiate the quality of disseminated scientific information through documentation or other means appropriate to the nature and importance of the information, balanced against resources required and the time available.<br /><br />Pre-dissemination review of scientific information disseminated by NIST is incorporated into the normal review processes for each type of information to take advantage of inherent quality checks that are part of the process of formulating the information. This review is at a level appropriate to the information, taking into account the information's importance, balanced against the resources required and the time available. NIST treats information quality as integral to every step in its process of developing the information, including creation, collection, maintenance, and dissemination. All scientific information disseminated by NIST receives a level of scrutiny commensurate with the critical nature of the information and its intended use.<br /><br />Pre-dissemination review of scientific information can be accomplished in a number of ways, including but not limited to combinations of the following:<br /><br />Active personal review of information by supervisors and managers, either by reviewing each individual dissemination, or selected samples, or by any other reasonable method.<br /><br />Use of quality check lists, charts, statistics, or other means of tracking quality.<br /><br />Careful design and monitoring of review processes to ensure they are effective.<br /><br />Peer monitoring during information preparation.<br /><br />Use of management controls.<br /><br />Review of comments from the public.<br /><br />Any other method which serves to enhance the objectivity, utility, and integrity of the information.<br /><br />In addition to the methods listed above, all technical communications, including manuscripts for technical journal publications; letters to the editor; manuscripts for the NIST Technical Publication Series; computer software documentation; and other forms of technical communication regardless of the media or method used, receive technical, policy, and editorial review by one of the NIST editorial review boards: Washington Editorial Review Board (WERB), Boulder Editorial Review Board (BERB), or JILA Editorial Review Board (JERB). Each review board is made up of a Chairperson and representatives of each major technical activity or division at that NIST site to ensure a broad array of technical expertise. Voting members of Editorial Review Boards must be employees with permanent appointments or retired NIST staff members. If requested by an Editorial Review Board, technical communications may also receive legal review by the Office of NIST Counsel.<br /><br />In addition, all NIST papers published in external scientific journals receive external peer review as provided by the individual journal. NIST does not assume a rebuttable presumption from these reviews, as allowed by the OMB guidelines; rather, NIST uses such external peer review as an additional pre-dissemination review process.<br /><br />Peer Review of Influential Scientific Information: \"Influential scientific information\" or \"highly influential scientific assessments\" that the agency intends to disseminate are subject to OMB's Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review (OMB Peer Review Bulletin), issued December 16, 2004 (70 FR 2664, Jan. 14, 2005). Peer review of these information products will be conducted in accordance with that Bulletin.<br /><br />Pre-dissemination Review Process for Financial Information (Economic Impact Studies and Policy Analyses):<br /><br />Economic impact studies prepared by NIST staff are reviewed by a NIST editorial review board; reports prepared by contractors are not. Instead, the contractor reports are reviewed by the NIST employees with oversight for the contract. In addition, economic impact studies funded by other agencies receive external peer review if required by the funding agency.<br /><br />Policy studies of financial issues prepared by NIST staff receive internal peer and management review, Department of Commerce review, and possibly higher level reviews, but are not reviewed by a NIST editorial review board.<br /><br />PART III. ADMINISTRATIVE CORRECTION MECHANISMA. Burden of Proof and Definitions<br /><br />1. Burden of Proof. The burden of proof is on the requester to show both the necessity and type of correction sought. The requester has the burden of rebutting the presumption that information subjected to formal, independent peer review is objective provided that, for \"influential scientific information,\" and \"highly influential scientific assessments,\" the peer review fulfills the requirements of the OMB Peer Review Bulletin.<br /><br />2. Definitions.<br /><br />Affected person means an individual or entity that uses, benefits from, or is harmed by the disseminated information at issue.<br /><br />Person means an individual, partnership, corporation, association, public or private organization, or State or local government.<br /><br />Responsible office means the office within an agency that is designated to make the initial decision on a request for correction based on that agency's information quality guidelines and standards. For NIST, this is the NIST Division.<br /><br />B. Procedures for Submission of Initial Requests for Correction<br /><br />1. Any affected person may request, where appropriate, timely correction of disseminated information that does not comply with applicable information quality guidelines and standards. An affected person should submit a request for such action to:<br /><br />Director,\u00a0NIST Management and Organization Office<br /><br />National Institute of Standards and Technology<br /><br />100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 3220<br /><br />Gaithersburg, MD 20899-3220<br /><br />Email:2. An initial request for correction of disseminated information must be made in writing and submitted to the point of contact identified in paragraph 1. above. Any employee receiving a misdirected request should make reasonable efforts to forward the request to the point of contact identified in paragraph 1. above, but the time for response does not commence until the responsible office receives the request.<br /><br />3. No initial request for correction will be considered under these procedures concerning:<br /><br />a matter not involving \"information;\"<br /><br />information that has not actually been \"disseminated;\" or<br /><br />disseminated information the correction of which would serve no useful purpose. For example, correction of disseminated information would serve no useful purpose with respect to information that is not valid, used, or useful after a stated short period of time (such as atomic time). However, this would not preclude a request for correction alleging a recurring or systemic problem resulting in repeated similar or consistent errors.<br /><br />Additionally, requests that are duplicative, repetitious, or frivolous may be rejected.<br /><br />Any request rejected under this provision will nevertheless be accounted for in the Department's report to OMB.<br /><br />4. At a minimum, to be considered proper, initial requests must include:<br /><br />the requester's name, current home or business address, and telephone number or electronic mail address (to assist with timely communication);<br /><br />a statement that the request for correction of information is submitted under Section 515 of Public Law 106-554 (to ensure correct and timely routing);<br /><br />an accurate citation to or description of the particular information disseminated which is the subject of the request, including: the date and source from which the requester obtained the information; the point and form of dissemination; an indication of which office or program disseminated the information (if known); and any other details that will assist in identifying the specific information which is the subject of the request;<br /><br />an explanation of how the requester is affected; and<br /><br />a specific statement of how the information at issue fails to comply with applicable information quality guidelines and standards and why the requester believes that the information is not correct.<br /><br />5. For any proper request (i.e., one including all the elements of III.B.4.) above, the Director, NIST Management and Organization Office will forward the proper request through the NIST Organizational Unit (\"OU\")\u00a0Director to the Chief of the NIST division responsible for the information dissemination being challenged (hereinafter called \"the Division Chief\"). The Director, NIST Management and Organization\u00a0Office will attempt to communicate either a decision on the request, or a statement of the status of the request and an estimated decision date, within 60 calendar days after receipt of the request.<br /><br />6. No action will be taken regarding a request not including all the elements of paragraph III.B.4. (including a request made by a person unaffected by the dissemination of the information), or a request that does not state a claim according to paragraph III.C.1. The submitter of any such request will be notified, usually within 60 calendar days, of this disposition, and, may amend the request and resubmit it. Whether resubmitted or not, such requests will be accounted for in the Department's annual report to OMB.<br /><br />7. A proper request received concerning information disseminated as part of and during the pendency of the comment period on a proposed rule or other action involving an opportunity for prior notice and public comment, including a request concerning the information forming the record of decision for such proposed rule or action, will be treated as a comment filed on that proposed rule or action, and will be addressed in issuance of any final rule or action.<br /><br />C. Action by the Responsible Office on Initial Requests for Correction<br /><br />1. Upon receipt of a proper request, the Division Chief will make a preliminary determination whether the request states a claim. A request for correction states a claim if it reasonably demonstrates, on the strength of the assertions made in the request alone, and assuming they are true and correct, that the information disseminated was based on a misapplication or non-application of applicable published information quality guidelines and standards. In other words, to state a claim, a request for correction must actually allege that NIST disseminated some information that does not comply with applicable information quality guidelines and standards.<br /><br />A determination that a request does not state a claim will be communicated, along with an explanation of the deficiencies, to the requester, by the Director, NIST Management and Organization Office, usually within 60 calendar days of receipt. The request may be amended and resubmitted as indicated in paragraph III.B.6. above.<br /><br />2. If a proper request is preliminarily determined to state a claim, the Division Chief will objectively investigate and analyze relevant material to determine whether the disseminated information complies with the applicable published information quality guidelines and standards. The Division Chief will make an initial decision, based on the request and any internal investigation and analysis, whether the information should be corrected because it does not comply with the applicable information quality guidelines and standards (\"granted request\") or not corrected because it does comply with the applicable information quality guidelines and standards (\"initial denial\"). The Division Chief will make an initial decision whether the information should be corrected and what, if any, corrective action should be taken. No opportunity for personal appearance, oral argument, or hearing is provided.<br /><br />If the agency determines that corrective action is appropriate, corrective measures may be taken through a number of forms, including but not limited to: personal contacts via letter or telephone, form letters, press releases, postings on an appropriate website, or withdrawal or correction of the information in question. The form of corrective action will be determined by the nature and timeliness of the information involved and such factors as the significance of the error on the use of the information, and the magnitude of the error.<br /><br />3. The Division Chief will communicate his/her initial decision or the status of the request through the NIST OU\u00a0Director to the Director, NIST Management and Organization Office, who will communicate the initial decision to the requester, usually within 60 calendar days of NIST's receipt of the request.<br /><br />4. The initial decision or status update will contain the name and title of the Division Chief and a notice that the requester may appeal an initial denial to the NIST Associate Director\u00a0for\u00a0Laboratory\u00a0Programs\u00a0(with the name, title, and address of that official), pursuant to paragraph III.D.1. below, within 30 calendar days of the date of the initial denial.<br /><br />An initial denial will become a final decision if no appeal is filed within 30 calendar days.<br /><br />D. Appeals from Initial Denial<br /><br />1. An appeal from an initial denial must be made within 30 calendar days of the date of the initial decision. Such appeal must be in writing and addressed to:<br /><br />NIST Associate Director for Laboratory Programs<br /><br />National Institute of Standards and Technology<br /><br />100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1000<br /><br />Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1000<br /><br />An appeal of an initial denial must include:<br /><br />the requester's name, current home or business address, and telephone number or electronic mail address (in order to ensure timely communication);<br /><br />a copy of the original request and any correspondence regarding the initial denial; and<br /><br />a statement of the reasons why the requester believes the initial denial was in error.<br /><br />2. Where an initial denial has been made concerning information that is part of a rule or other action identified in paragraph III.B.7., and an administrative appeal mechanism, such as a reconsideration process, exists, an appeal will be considered pursuant to that process.<br /><br />3. The NIST Associate Director for Laboratory Programs will decide whether the information should be corrected based on all the information presented in the appeal record. No opportunity for personal appearance, oral argument, or hearing on appeal is provided. The NIST Associate Director for Laboratory Programs will communicate that decision to the requester usually within 60 calendar days after receipt of the appeal. The decision of the NIST Associate Director for Laboratory Programs will constitute a final decision by the DOC.<br /><br />Created July 31, 2009, Updated May 22, 2018<br /><br />HEADQUARTERS<br /><br />100 Bureau Drive<br /><br />Gaithersburg, MD 20899<br /><br />301-975-2000<br /><br />|  |How are we doing?<br /><br />", "publish_time": 1569735289865, "collection_time": 1569735289865, "summary": "Based on the review it has conducted, NIST believes that it does not currently produce or sponsor the distribution of...", "source": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u5bb6\u6807\u51c6\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u9662"}

As a result, at this time NIST has no agenda of forthcoming influential scientific disseminations to post on its website in accordance with .<br /><br />NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY<br /><br />GUIDELINES, INFORMATION QUALITY STANDARDS, AND<br /><br />ADMINISTRATIVE MECHANISM<br /><br />PART I: BACKGROUND, MISSION, DEFINITIONS, AND SCOPE<br /><br />BACKGROUNDSection 515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (Public Law 106-554), hereinafter \"Section 515,\" directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue government-wide guidelines that \"provide policy and procedural guidance to Federal agencies for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information (including statistical information) disseminated by Federal agencies.\" OMB complied by issuing guidelines which direct each Federal agency to (A) issue its own guidelines ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information disseminated by the agency; (B) establish administrative mechanisms allowing affected persons to seek and obtain correction of information that does not comply with the OMB 515 Guidelines (Federal Register: February 22, 2002, Volume 67, Number 36, pp. 8452-8460, hereinafter \"OMB Guidelines\") and the agency guidelines; and (C) report periodically to the Director of OMB on the number and nature of complaints received by the agency regarding the accuracy of information disseminated by the agency and how such complaints were handled by the agency.<br /><br />In compliance with OMB directives, the Department of Commerce (DOC) has issued Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Disseminated Information ().<br /><br />This document implements Section 515 and fulfills the OMB and DOC information quality guidelines. It may be revised periodically, based on experience, evolving requirements in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and concerns expressed by the public. Covered information disseminated by NIST will comply with all applicable OMB, DOC, and NIST Information Quality Guidelines and Standards. NIST is committed to maintaining a high level of quality in the information it disseminates.<br /><br />In implementing these guidelines and standards, NIST acknowledges that ensuring the quality of information is an important management objective that takes its place alongside other NIST objectives, such as ensuring the success of the NIST mission, observing budget and resource priorities and restraints, and providing useful information to the public. NIST intends to implement these guidelines and standards in a way that will achieve all these objectives in a harmonious way.<br /><br />MISSIONNIST's mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.<br /><br />DEFINITIONS<br /><br />The definitions in this section apply throughout these Guidelines and Standards.<br /><br />Quality is an encompassing term comprising utility, objectivity, and integrity. Therefore, the guidelines sometimes refer to these four statutory terms, collectively, as \"quality.\"<br /><br />Utility refers to the usefulness of the information to its intended users, including the public. In assessing the usefulness of information that the agency disseminates to the public, NIST considers the uses of the information not only from its own perspective but also from the perspective of the public. As a result, when transparency of information is relevant for assessing the information's usefulness from the public's perspective, NIST takes care to ensure that transparency has been addressed in its review of the information.<br /><br />Objectivity consists of two distinct elements: presentation and substance. The presentation element includes whether disseminated information is presented in an accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased manner and in a proper context. The substance element involves a focus on ensuring accurate, reliable, and unbiased information. In a scientific, financial, or statistical context, the original and supporting data will be generated, and the analytic results will be developed, using sound statistical and research methods.<br /><br />Integrity refers to security \u2013 the protection of information from unauthorized access or revision, to ensure that the information is not compromised through corruption or falsification.<br /><br />Information means any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts or data, in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative, or audiovisual forms. This definition includes information that an agency disseminates from a Web page, but does not include the provision of hyperlinks to information that others disseminate. This definition does not include opinions, where the agency's presentation makes it clear that what is being offered is someone's opinion rather than fact or the agency's views.<br /><br />Government information means information created, collected, processed, disseminated, or disposed of by or for the Federal Government.<br /><br />Information dissemination product means any books, paper, map, machine-readable material, audiovisual production, or other documentary material, regardless of physical form or characteristic, an agency disseminates to the public. This definition includes any electronic document, CD-ROM, or Web page.<br /><br />Dissemination means agency initiated or sponsored distribution of information to the public. Dissemination does not include distribution limited to government employees or agency contractors or grantees; intra- or inter-agency use or sharing of government information; and responses to requests for agency records under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Federal Advisory Committee Act or other similar law. This definition also does not include distribution limited to correspondence with individuals or persons, press releases, archival records, public filings, subpoenas or adjudicative processes.<br /><br />Agency initiated distribution of information to the public refers to information that the Agency distributes or releases which reflects, represents, or forms any part of the support of the policies of the Agency. In addition, if the Agency, as an institution, distributes or releases information prepared by an outside party in a manner that reasonably suggests that the Agency agrees with the information, this would be considered Agency initiated distribution and hence Agency dissemination because of the appearance of having the information represent Agency views.<br /><br />Agency sponsored distribution of information to the public refers to situations where the Agency has directed a third party to distribute or release information, or where the Agency has the authority to review and approve the information before release. By contrast, if the Agency simply provides funding to support research, and if the researcher (not the Agency) decides whether to distribute the results and - if the results are to be released - determines the content and presentation of the distribution, then the Agency has not \"sponsored\" the dissemination even though it has funded the research and even if the Agency retains ownership or other intellectual property rights because the Federal government paid for the research.<br /><br />Influential, when used in the phrase \"influential scientific, financial, or statistical information,'' means that the agency can reasonably determine that dissemination of the information will have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policy and private sector decisions.<br /><br />Scientific information means factual inputs, data, models, analyses, technical information, or scientific assessments based on the behavioral and social sciences, public health and medical sciences, life and earth sciences, engineering, or physical sciences. This includes any communication or representation of knowledge such as facts or data, in any medium or form, including textual, numerical, graphic, cartographic, narrative or audiovisual forms that involves a field identified in the preceding sentence. This definition includes scientific information that an agency disseminates from a web page, but does not include the provision of hyperlinks to scientific information that others disseminate. This definition does not include opinions, where the agency's presentation makes clear that what is being offered is someone's opinion rather than fact or the agency's views.<br /><br />Influential scientific information means scientific information the agency reasonably can determine will have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or private sector decisions.<br /><br />Scientific assessment means an evaluation of a body of scientific or technical knowledge, which typically synthesizes multiple factual inputs, data, models, assumptions, and/or applies best professional judgment to bridge uncertainties in the available information. These assessments include, but are not limited to, state of science reports; technology assessments; weight of evidence analyses; meta analyses; health, safety, or ecological risk assessments; toxicological characterizations of substances; integrated assessment models; hazard determinations; or exposure assessments.<br /><br />The term highly influential scientific assessment means influential scientific information that the agency or the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget determines to be a scientific assessment that: (i) could have a potential impact of more than $500 million in any year, or (ii) is novel, controversial, or precedent setting or has significant interagency interest.<br /><br />Reproducibility means that the information is capable of being substantially reproduced, subject to an acceptable degree of imprecision. For information judged to have more (less) important impacts, the degree of imprecision that is tolerated is reduced (increased). With respect to analytic results, \"capable of being substantially reproduced'' means that independent analysis of the original or supporting data using identical methods would generate similar analytic results, subject to an acceptable degree of imprecision or error.<br /><br />Transparency is not defined in the OMB Guidelines, but the Supplementary Information to the OMB Guidelines indicates (p. 8456) that \"transparency\" is at the heart of the reproducibility standard. The Guidelines state that \"The purpose of the reproducibility standard is to cultivate a consistent agency commitment to transparency about how analytic results are generated: the specific data used, the various assumptions employed, the specific analytic methods applied, and the statistical procedures employed. If sufficient transparency is achieved on each of these matters, then an analytic result should meet the reproducibility standard.\" In others words, transparency \u2013 and ultimately reproducibility \u2013 is a matter of showing how you got the results being disseminated.<br /><br />SCOPEThese guidelines cover information disseminated by NIST on or after October 1, 2002, regardless of when the information was first disseminated, except that pre-dissemination review procedures shall apply only to information first disseminated on or after October 1, 2002.<br /><br />Information Disseminated by NIST and Covered by these Guidelines and StandardsCorporate or general information includes all non-scientific, non-financial, non-statistical information. NIST disseminates many types of non-scientific, non-financial, non-statistical information, including but not limited to:<br /><br />Non-scientific training materials;<br /><br />Catalogs for NIST products and services;<br /><br />Descriptive programmatic information, including brochures, pamphlets, newsletters, fact sheets, and website descriptions;<br /><br />NIST Laboratory and Division annual reports;<br /><br />Directories;<br /><br />Program handbooks, manuals, and guidelines;<br /><br />NIST impacts by state;<br /><br />Conference information;<br /><br />Job opportunities;<br /><br />NIST videos; and<br /><br />Lists of accredited laboratories and validated products.<br /><br />Scientific, financial, and statistical information includes all scientific, financial, and statistical information disseminated by NIST. NIST disseminates scientific and financial information to the public in a variety of formats, including but not limited to data, databases, standard reference materials, scientific papers, economic impact studies, technical talks and presentations, exhibits, and web sites.<br /><br />Information quality is an integral part of the pre-dissemination review of information disseminated by NIST. Information quality is also integral to information collections conducted by NIST, and is incorporated into the clearance process required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) to help improve the quality of information that NIST collects and disseminates to the public. NIST programs already are required to demonstrate in their PRA submissions to OMB the utility of a proposed collection of information that they plan to disseminate. Additionally, for all proposed collections of information that will be disseminated to the public, NIST programs should demonstrate in their PRA clearance submissions to OMB that the proposed collection of information will result in information that will be collected, maintained, and used in a way consistent with applicable information quality guidelines and standards.<br /><br />Information Not Covered by these Guidelines<br /><br />Information with distribution intended to be limited to government employees or agency contractors or grantees, including but not limited to the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Extranet Information for Center grantees.<br /><br />Information with distribution intended to be limited to intra- or inter-agency use or sharing of government information, including but not limited to programmatic performance, budget, human resources and strategic planning information submitted to the DOC.<br /><br />Responses to requests for agency records under the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Federal Advisory Committee Act or other similar law.<br /><br />Information relating solely to correspondence with individuals or persons, including but not limited to calibration reports, and Internal or Interagency Reports prepared and released to a single customer.<br /><br />Press releases, fact sheets, press conferences or similar communications in any medium that announce, support the announcement or give public notice of information NIST has disseminated elsewhere.<br /><br />Archival records, including library holdings.<br /><br />Archival information disseminated by NIST before October 1, 2002, and still maintained by NIST as archival material.<br /><br />Information presented to Congress as part of legislative or oversight processes, such as testimony of NIST officials, and information or drafting assistance provided to Congress in connection with proposed or pending legislation, that is not simultaneously disseminated to the public.<br /><br />Public filings.<br /><br />Subpoenas.Information limited to adjudicative processes, such as pleadings, including information developed during the conduct of any criminal or civil action or administrative enforcement action, investigation or audit against specific parties, or information distributed in documents limited to administrative action determining the rights and liabilities of specific parties under applicable statutes and regulations.<br /><br />Solicitations (e.g., program announcements, requests for proposals).<br /><br />Hyperlinks to information that others disseminate, as well as paper-based information from other sources referenced, but not approved or endorsed by NIST.<br /><br />Policy manuals and management information produced for the internal management and operations of NIST, and not primarily intended for public dissemination.<br /><br />Documents not authored by NIST and not intended to represent NIST's views, including information authored and distributed by NIST grantees, as long as the documents are not disseminated by NIST.<br /><br />Research data, findings, reports and other materials published or otherwise distributed by employees or by NIST contractors or grantees that are identified as not representing NIST views.<br /><br />Opinions where the presentation makes it clear that what is being offered is not the official view of NIST.<br /><br />Although information delivered to specific customers is not \"disseminated\" for purposes of these information quality standards, NIST's commitment to quality extends to this information. For example, NIST has entered into a Mutual Recognition Arrangement with the International Committee on Weights and Measures (CIPM), pursuant to which NIST has adopted a system for assuring quality in the results of measurements delivered to customers in calibration and measurement certificates.<br /><br />In addition, NIST releases software and algorithms. Some of this information is released as a service to the public, and the release of the information is not intended to imply NIST endorsement or adoption of the information. For this information, NIST will attach a disclaimer.<br /><br />PART II: INFORMATION QUALITY STANDARDS AND PRE-DISSEMINATION REVIEW<br /><br />Information quality is composed of three elements - utility, integrity and objectivity. Quality will be ensured and established at levels appropriate to the nature and timeliness of the information to be disseminated. Information quality is an integral part of the pre-dissemination review of information disseminated by NIST. Information quality is also integral to information collections conducted by NIST, and is incorporated into the clearance process required by the Paperwork Reduction Act.<br /><br />As OMB has recognized (OMB Guidelines, pp. 8452-8453), \"information quality comes at a cost.\" In this context, OMB directed that \"agencies should weigh the costs (for example, including costs attributable to agency processing effort, respondent burden, maintenance of needed privacy, and assurances of suitable confidentiality) and the benefits of higher information quality in the development of information, and the level of quality to which the information disseminated will be held.\" Therefore, in deciding the appropriate level of review and documentation for information disseminated by NIST, the costs and benefits of using a higher quality standard or a more extensive review process will be considered. Where necessary, other compelling interests such as privacy and confidentiality protections will be considered.<br /><br />The utility and integrity standards below pertain to all information disseminated by NIST. Following the utility and integrity standards are objectivity standards for each of the specific categories of NIST-disseminated information. Because most of the standards presented in this document reflect existing practice in NIST, the present tense has been used when describing them; but regardless of tense used, a performance standard is intended.<br /><br />UTILITYUtility means that disseminated information is useful to its intended users. \"Useful\" means that the content of the information is helpful, beneficial, or serviceable to its intended users, or that the information supports the usefulness of other disseminated information by making it more accessible or easier to read, see, understand, obtain, or use. Where the usefulness of information will be enhanced by greater transparency, care is taken that sufficient background and detail is available, either with the disseminated information or through other means, to maximize the usefulness of the information. The level of such background and detail is commensurate with the importance of the particular information, balanced against the resources required, and is appropriate to the nature and timeliness of the information to be disseminated.<br /><br />NIST's mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. NIST maintains ongoing contact with a broad spectrum of users through a variety of means, including but not limited to public meetings, public workshops, individual contacts, and formal and informal collaborations and partnerships, to ensure that the information it disseminates continues to remain relevant. NIST attends and holds public workshops, conferences, and meetings to gather input about what types of information would be useful to industry; universities; other not-for-profit entities; and Federal, state, and local governments; and maintains memberships in many industry groups for the purpose of facilitating such discussions.<br /><br />INTEGRITYPrior to dissemination, NIST information, independent of the specific intended distribution mechanism, is safeguarded from improper access, modification, or destruction, to a degree commensurate with the risk and magnitude of harm that could result from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of such information.<br /><br />All electronic information disseminated by NIST adheres to the standards set out in Appendix III, \"Security of Automated Information Resources,\" OMB Circular A-130; the Computer Security Act, and the Government Information Systems Reform Act.<br /><br />Confidentiality of data collected by NIST is safeguarded under legislation such as the Privacy Act and Titles 13, 15, and 22 of the U.S. Code.<br /><br />OBJECTIVITY<br /><br />Objectivity ensures that information is accurate, reliable, and unbiased, and that information products are presented in an accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased manner. In a scientific, financial, or statistical context, the original and supporting data are generated, and the analytic results are developed, using sound statistical and research methods.<br /><br />Third-party Information. Third-party information from both domestic and international sources, such as states, municipalities, agencies and private entities may be included in information that NIST disseminates. Although third-party sources may not be directly subject to Section 515, information from such sources, when used by NIST to develop information products or to form the basis of a decision or policy, must be of known quality and consistent with the applicable information quality guidelines and standards. When such information is used, any limitations, assumptions, collection methods, or uncertainties concerning it are taken into account and disclosed.<br /><br />Corporate and General Information. Corporate and general information disseminated by NIST is presented in a clear, complete, and unbiased manner, and in a context that enhances usability to the intended audience. The sources of the disseminated information are identified to the extent possible, consistent with confidentiality, privacy, and security considerations and protections, and taking into account timely presentation, the medium of dissemination, and the importance of the information, balanced against the resources required and the time available.<br /><br />Information disseminated by NIST is reliable and accurate to an acceptable degree of error as determined by factors such as the importance of the information, its intended use, time sensitivity, expected degree of permanence, relation to the primary mission(s) of the disseminating office, and the context of the dissemination, balanced against the resources required and the time available. A body of information is considered to be reliable if experience shows it to be generally accurate. Accurate information, in the case of non-scientific, non-financial, non-statistical information, means information which is reasonably determined to be factually correct in the view of the disseminating office as of the time of dissemination.<br /><br />Review of corporate and general information disseminated by NIST is incorporated into the normal process of formulating the information to take advantage of inherent quality checks that are part of the process of formulating the information. This review is at a level appropriate to the information, taking into account the information's importance, balanced against the resources required and the time available. NIST treats information quality as integral to every step in its process of developing the information, including creation, collection, maintenance, and dissemination.<br /><br />Review can be accomplished in a number of ways, including but not limited to combinations of the following:<br /><br />Active personal review of information by supervisors and managers, either by reviewing each individual dissemination, or selected samples, or by any other reasonable method.<br /><br />Use of quality check lists, charts, statistics, or other means of tracking quality, completeness, and usefulness.<br /><br />Process design and monitoring to ensure that the process itself imposes checks on information quality.<br /><br />Peer monitoring during information preparation.<br /><br />Use of management controls.<br /><br />Review of comments from the public.<br /><br />Any other method which serves to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and objectivity of the information.<br /><br />Scientific, Financial, and Statistical Information. Scientific and financial information disseminated by NIST is presented in a clear, complete, and unbiased manner, and in a context which enhances usability to the intended audience. The sources of the disseminated information are identified to the extent possible, consistent with confidentiality, privacy, and security considerations and protections, and taking into account timely presentation, the medium of dissemination, and the importance of the information, balanced against the resources required and the time available.<br /><br />Scientific and financial information disseminated by NIST is reliable and accurate to an acceptable degree of error as determined by factors such as the importance of the information, its intended use, time sensitivity, expected degree of permanence, relation to the primary mission(s) of the disseminating office, and the context of the dissemination, balanced against the resources required and the time available. A body of information is considered to be reliable if experience shows it to be generally accurate. Accurate information, in the case of scientific and financial information, means information which is reasonably determined to be factually correct in the view of the disseminating office as of the time of dissemination.<br /><br />Influential, when used in the phrase \"influential scientific, financial, or statistical information,\" means that NIST can reasonably determine that dissemination of the information will have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or important private sector decisions.<br /><br />Preparation of Scientific Information<br /><br />Laboratory Notebooks: To appropriately document the preparation of scientific information, NIST maintains a policy regarding laboratory notebooks. NIST Laboratory staff engaged in measurement and in research and development activities are responsible for maintaining a thorough and accurate record of their work by keeping a laboratory or research notebook. Staff using electronic media for measurement, research, and development are responsible for maintaining a written notebook that chronologically documents the progress of their activity and indexes work files so that experimental data and results may be retrieved. The implementation of this policy provides transparency as to the sources of data and the methodologies used to prepare the information disseminated. It also provides the means for ensuring \"reproducibility\" as defined in the OMB guidelines:<br /><br />\"Reproducibility\" means that the information is capable of being substantially reproduced, subject to an acceptable degree of imprecision. For information judged to have more (less) important impacts, the degree of imprecision that is tolerated is reduced (increased). If agencies apply the reproducibility test to specific types of original or supporting data, the associate guidelines shall provide relevant definitions of reproducibility (e.g., standards for replication of laboratory data). With respect to analytic results, \"capable of being substantially reproduced\" means that independent analysis of the original or supporting data using identical methods would generate similar analytic results, subject to an acceptable degree of imprecision or error.<br /><br />Uncertainty Policy: NIST maintains a policy entitled \"Guidelines for Evaluating and Expressing the Uncertainty of NIST Measurement Results\" (NIST Technical Note 1297, 1994 Edition) (See .) The policy requires that NIST measurement results be accompanied by quantitative statements of their uncertainty, and that a uniform approach to expressing measurement uncertainty be followed. The policy applies to most NIST measurement results, including results associated with international comparisons of measurement standards, basic research, applied research and engineering, calibrating client measurement standards, certifying standard reference materials, and generating standard reference data. The implementation of this policy provides additional transparency as to the accuracy of the information disseminated.<br /><br />Pre-dissemination Review Process for Scientific Information<br /><br />The pre-dissemination review process enables NIST to substantiate the quality of disseminated scientific information through documentation or other means appropriate to the nature and importance of the information, balanced against resources required and the time available.<br /><br />Pre-dissemination review of scientific information disseminated by NIST is incorporated into the normal review processes for each type of information to take advantage of inherent quality checks that are part of the process of formulating the information. This review is at a level appropriate to the information, taking into account the information's importance, balanced against the resources required and the time available. NIST treats information quality as integral to every step in its process of developing the information, including creation, collection, maintenance, and dissemination. All scientific information disseminated by NIST receives a level of scrutiny commensurate with the critical nature of the information and its intended use.<br /><br />Pre-dissemination review of scientific information can be accomplished in a number of ways, including but not limited to combinations of the following:<br /><br />Active personal review of information by supervisors and managers, either by reviewing each individual dissemination, or selected samples, or by any other reasonable method.<br /><br />Use of quality check lists, charts, statistics, or other means of tracking quality.<br /><br />Careful design and monitoring of review processes to ensure they are effective.<br /><br />Peer monitoring during information preparation.<br /><br />Use of management controls.<br /><br />Review of comments from the public.<br /><br />Any other method which serves to enhance the objectivity, utility, and integrity of the information.<br /><br />In addition to the methods listed above, all technical communications, including manuscripts for technical journal publications; letters to the editor; manuscripts for the NIST Technical Publication Series; computer software documentation; and other forms of technical communication regardless of the media or method used, receive technical, policy, and editorial review by one of the NIST editorial review boards: Washington Editorial Review Board (WERB), Boulder Editorial Review Board (BERB), or JILA Editorial Review Board (JERB). Each review board is made up of a Chairperson and representatives of each major technical activity or division at that NIST site to ensure a broad array of technical expertise. Voting members of Editorial Review Boards must be employees with permanent appointments or retired NIST staff members. If requested by an Editorial Review Board, technical communications may also receive legal review by the Office of NIST Counsel.<br /><br />In addition, all NIST papers published in external scientific journals receive external peer review as provided by the individual journal. NIST does not assume a rebuttable presumption from these reviews, as allowed by the OMB guidelines; rather, NIST uses such external peer review as an additional pre-dissemination review process.<br /><br />Peer Review of Influential Scientific Information: \"Influential scientific information\" or \"highly influential scientific assessments\" that the agency intends to disseminate are subject to OMB's Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review (OMB Peer Review Bulletin), issued December 16, 2004 (70 FR 2664, Jan. 14, 2005). Peer review of these information products will be conducted in accordance with that Bulletin.<br /><br />Pre-dissemination Review Process for Financial Information (Economic Impact Studies and Policy Analyses):<br /><br />Economic impact studies prepared by NIST staff are reviewed by a NIST editorial review board; reports prepared by contractors are not. Instead, the contractor reports are reviewed by the NIST employees with oversight for the contract. In addition, economic impact studies funded by other agencies receive external peer review if required by the funding agency.<br /><br />Policy studies of financial issues prepared by NIST staff receive internal peer and management review, Department of Commerce review, and possibly higher level reviews, but are not reviewed by a NIST editorial review board.<br /><br />PART III. ADMINISTRATIVE CORRECTION MECHANISMA. Burden of Proof and Definitions<br /><br />1. Burden of Proof. The burden of proof is on the requester to show both the necessity and type of correction sought. The requester has the burden of rebutting the presumption that information subjected to formal, independent peer review is objective provided that, for \"influential scientific information,\" and \"highly influential scientific assessments,\" the peer review fulfills the requirements of the OMB Peer Review Bulletin.<br /><br />2. Definitions.<br /><br />Affected person means an individual or entity that uses, benefits from, or is harmed by the disseminated information at issue.<br /><br />Person means an individual, partnership, corporation, association, public or private organization, or State or local government.<br /><br />Responsible office means the office within an agency that is designated to make the initial decision on a request for correction based on that agency's information quality guidelines and standards. For NIST, this is the NIST Division.<br /><br />B. Procedures for Submission of Initial Requests for Correction<br /><br />1. Any affected person may request, where appropriate, timely correction of disseminated information that does not comply with applicable information quality guidelines and standards. An affected person should submit a request for such action to:<br /><br />Director,\u00a0NIST Management and Organization Office<br /><br />National Institute of Standards and Technology<br /><br />100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 3220<br /><br />Gaithersburg, MD 20899-3220<br /><br />Email:2. An initial request for correction of disseminated information must be made in writing and submitted to the point of contact identified in paragraph 1. above. Any employee receiving a misdirected request should make reasonable efforts to forward the request to the point of contact identified in paragraph 1. above, but the time for response does not commence until the responsible office receives the request.<br /><br />3. No initial request for correction will be considered under these procedures concerning:<br /><br />a matter not involving \"information;\"<br /><br />information that has not actually been \"disseminated;\" or<br /><br />disseminated information the correction of which would serve no useful purpose. For example, correction of disseminated information would serve no useful purpose with respect to information that is not valid, used, or useful after a stated short period of time (such as atomic time). However, this would not preclude a request for correction alleging a recurring or systemic problem resulting in repeated similar or consistent errors.<br /><br />Additionally, requests that are duplicative, repetitious, or frivolous may be rejected.<br /><br />Any request rejected under this provision will nevertheless be accounted for in the Department's report to OMB.<br /><br />4. At a minimum, to be considered proper, initial requests must include:<br /><br />the requester's name, current home or business address, and telephone number or electronic mail address (to assist with timely communication);<br /><br />a statement that the request for correction of information is submitted under Section 515 of Public Law 106-554 (to ensure correct and timely routing);<br /><br />an accurate citation to or description of the particular information disseminated which is the subject of the request, including: the date and source from which the requester obtained the information; the point and form of dissemination; an indication of which office or program disseminated the information (if known); and any other details that will assist in identifying the specific information which is the subject of the request;<br /><br />an explanation of how the requester is affected; and<br /><br />a specific statement of how the information at issue fails to comply with applicable information quality guidelines and standards and why the requester believes that the information is not correct.<br /><br />5. For any proper request (i.e., one including all the elements of III.B.4.) above, the Director, NIST Management and Organization Office will forward the proper request through the NIST Organizational Unit (\"OU\")\u00a0Director to the Chief of the NIST division responsible for the information dissemination being challenged (hereinafter called \"the Division Chief\"). The Director, NIST Management and Organization\u00a0Office will attempt to communicate either a decision on the request, or a statement of the status of the request and an estimated decision date, within 60 calendar days after receipt of the request.<br /><br />6. No action will be taken regarding a request not including all the elements of paragraph III.B.4. (including a request made by a person unaffected by the dissemination of the information), or a request that does not state a claim according to paragraph III.C.1. The submitter of any such request will be notified, usually within 60 calendar days, of this disposition, and, may amend the request and resubmit it. Whether resubmitted or not, such requests will be accounted for in the Department's annual report to OMB.<br /><br />7. A proper request received concerning information disseminated as part of and during the pendency of the comment period on a proposed rule or other action involving an opportunity for prior notice and public comment, including a request concerning the information forming the record of decision for such proposed rule or action, will be treated as a comment filed on that proposed rule or action, and will be addressed in issuance of any final rule or action.<br /><br />C. Action by the Responsible Office on Initial Requests for Correction<br /><br />1. Upon receipt of a proper request, the Division Chief will make a preliminary determination whether the request states a claim. A request for correction states a claim if it reasonably demonstrates, on the strength of the assertions made in the request alone, and assuming they are true and correct, that the information disseminated was based on a misapplication or non-application of applicable published information quality guidelines and standards. In other words, to state a claim, a request for correction must actually allege that NIST disseminated some information that does not comply with applicable information quality guidelines and standards.<br /><br />A determination that a request does not state a claim will be communicated, along with an explanation of the deficiencies, to the requester, by the Director, NIST Management and Organization Office, usually within 60 calendar days of receipt. The request may be amended and resubmitted as indicated in paragraph III.B.6. above.<br /><br />2. If a proper request is preliminarily determined to state a claim, the Division Chief will objectively investigate and analyze relevant material to determine whether the disseminated information complies with the applicable published information quality guidelines and standards. The Division Chief will make an initial decision, based on the request and any internal investigation and analysis, whether the information should be corrected because it does not comply with the applicable information quality guidelines and standards (\"granted request\") or not corrected because it does comply with the applicable information quality guidelines and standards (\"initial denial\"). The Division Chief will make an initial decision whether the information should be corrected and what, if any, corrective action should be taken. No opportunity for personal appearance, oral argument, or hearing is provided.<br /><br />If the agency determines that corrective action is appropriate, corrective measures may be taken through a number of forms, including but not limited to: personal contacts via letter or telephone, form letters, press releases, postings on an appropriate website, or withdrawal or correction of the information in question. The form of corrective action will be determined by the nature and timeliness of the information involved and such factors as the significance of the error on the use of the information, and the magnitude of the error.<br /><br />3. The Division Chief will communicate his/her initial decision or the status of the request through the NIST OU\u00a0Director to the Director, NIST Management and Organization Office, who will communicate the initial decision to the requester, usually within 60 calendar days of NIST's receipt of the request.<br /><br />4. The initial decision or status update will contain the name and title of the Division Chief and a notice that the requester may appeal an initial denial to the NIST Associate Director\u00a0for\u00a0Laboratory\u00a0Programs\u00a0(with the name, title, and address of that official), pursuant to paragraph III.D.1. below, within 30 calendar days of the date of the initial denial.<br /><br />An initial denial will become a final decision if no appeal is filed within 30 calendar days.<br /><br />D. Appeals from Initial Denial<br /><br />1. An appeal from an initial denial must be made within 30 calendar days of the date of the initial decision. Such appeal must be in writing and addressed to:<br /><br />NIST Associate Director for Laboratory Programs<br /><br />National Institute of Standards and Technology<br /><br />100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 1000<br /><br />Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1000<br /><br />An appeal of an initial denial must include:<br /><br />the requester's name, current home or business address, and telephone number or electronic mail address (in order to ensure timely communication);<br /><br />a copy of the original request and any correspondence regarding the initial denial; and<br /><br />a statement of the reasons why the requester believes the initial denial was in error.<br /><br />2. Where an initial denial has been made concerning information that is part of a rule or other action identified in paragraph III.B.7., and an administrative appeal mechanism, such as a reconsideration process, exists, an appeal will be considered pursuant to that process.<br /><br />3. The NIST Associate Director for Laboratory Programs will decide whether the information should be corrected based on all the information presented in the appeal record. No opportunity for personal appearance, oral argument, or hearing on appeal is provided. The NIST Associate Director for Laboratory Programs will communicate that decision to the requester usually within 60 calendar days after receipt of the appeal. The decision of the NIST Associate Director for Laboratory Programs will constitute a final decision by the DOC.<br /><br />Created July 31, 2009, Updated May 22, 2018<br /><br />HEADQUARTERS<br /><br />100 Bureau Drive<br /><br />Gaithersburg, MD 20899<br /><br />301-975-2000<br /><br />|  |How are we doing?<br /><br />", "publish_time": 1569735289865, "collection_time": 1569735289865, "summary": "Based on the review it has conducted, NIST believes that it does not currently produce or sponsor the distribution of...", "source": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u5bb6\u6807\u51c6\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u9662"}

NIST's mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. NIST carries out its mission through four cooperative programs: the NIST Laboratories, conducting research that advances that nation's technology infrastructure and is needed by U.S. industry to continually improve products and services; the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program, which promotes performance excellence among U.S. manufacturers, service companies, educational institutions, health care providers, and nonprofit organizations, conducts outreach programs, and manages the annual Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award which recognizes performance excellence and quality achievement; the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a nationwide network of local centers offering technical and business assistance to smaller manufacturers; and the Technology Innovation Program, which provides cost-shared technologies that address critical national and societal needs.In accordance with the Memorandum of December 17, 2010, from the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, NIST is currently working to update its relevant policies, including through revision of NIST Administrative Manual (NIST Manual), to more broadly address issues of Scientific Integrity. Relevant policies currently in effect are summarized below.I. \u00a0Foundation of Scientific Integrity in GovernmentNIST has in place a number of policies and procedures to ensure the integrity of the scientific and technological information it develops and disseminates to the public. Those policies and procedures include rigorous internal peer review of any published scientific and technological information.The NIST Manual sets forth policies and defines responsibilities that apply to the communication of NIST technical program results by staff members, guest researchers, research associates, and others who participate in the performance of NIST technical programs. Those NIST Manual policies and procedures explicitly apply to technical publications in all media including (but not limited to) hardcopy print media and machine-readable media (magnetic disk, magnetic tape, electronic storage devices, CD-ROM, and other forms of optical storage of information), and photographic film, as well as to all transmittals of new findings from NIST technical programs regardless of the means of communication, e.g., communication of new findings by telephone, telefax, direct electronic data transfer, videotape, or other special means.Thus, for example, the NIST Manual explains that all NIST technical communications are derived from the technical activities of its employees and supported by the technological records (e.g., research notebooks) they maintain. It is NIST policy that all NIST employees engaged in research and development activities are responsible for maintaining a thorough and accurate record of their work by keeping a research notebook following internal Operating Unit (OU) policies.Recognizing that scientific data at NIST are increasingly generated, stored and reported digitally, the NIST Leadership Board established a Scientific Data Lifecycle Management Working Group in December of 2009, to study the collection, storage, use, repurposing and preservation of NIST's digital scientific data. Composed of scientists and managers from across the Institute, the NIST Working Group was formed as a response to a report by the Interagency Working Group on Digital Data (IWGDD) operating under the Committee on Science of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC). The IWGDD report, entitled \"Harnessing the Power of Digital Data for Science and Society,\"1 called attention to the need for Federal research organizations to establish scientific data management policies, and underscored the risks of failing to do so. In carrying out its charter, the NIST Working Group also considered that the Administration has promoted a higher level of transparency, accessibility, and citizen engagement with the work products and operations of all Federal agencies. These factors served as the impetus to review and suggest improvements to NIST's management of digital data. The NIST Working Group is expected to issue its final report and recommendations in the second quarter of 2011.All official writing (as defined in Departmental Administrative Order DAO 219-1) must be reviewed by an internal Editorial Review Board, and approved for publication in accordance with procedures defined in the NIST Manual. The Editorial Review Boards at NIST are responsible for the final review and approval of all technical manuscripts produced by NIST.There are two NIST Editorial Review Boards, which are Standing Committees of NIST and are responsible to the Director: (1) The Washington Editorial Review Board (WERB) is responsible for the review and approval of technical manuscripts prepared by authors and coauthors at Gaithersburg; and (2) The Boulder Editorial Review Board (BERB) is responsible for the review and approval of technical manuscripts prepared by authors and coauthors at Boulder. All NIST technical manuscripts must be reviewed and approved by the responsible division chief with the originating OU before the manuscript is submitted to the appropriate NIST editorial Review Board.According to the NIST Manual, Editorial Review Board decisions that do not approve publications are accompanied by recommendations to the author(s) that, if accepted, will result in approval; if such recommendations are not accepted, the authors may seek resolution of the issues through direct discussions with the Chairperson of the Editorial Review Board. After all other remedies have been exhausted, the Editorial Review Board decision may be appealed through the responsible OU Director to the NIST Director. If a decision by an Editorial Review Board is overruled by the NIST Director, the Editorial Review Board must be informed.The NIST Manual also contemplates that NIST employees may publish \"nonofficial\" manuscripts subject to prior review to ensure that the government has neither proprietary nor regulatory interest.The NIST Manual expresses NIST policy to strive to publish openly, widely, and promptly the results of all technical programs. Therefore, it is noted that agreements to perform technical work for other organizations (which would include other Federal agencies) must include a provision that addresses the publication of such results either by NIST or by the sponsoring organization, and that any provision for the delay of publication beyond three months after the completion of the technical work, or any provision that would otherwise limit publication, requires the approval of the responsible NIST OU Director.Under NIST Policy, NIST reports of work sponsored by other Federal agencies, regardless of the form they take or the media used, are subject to the same quality control requirements as all other technical reports of NIST. These requirements include the procedures for review and approval specified in the NIST Manual.NIST affirmatively encourages excellence in published research through the performance payout process of the NIST Personnel Management Demonstration Project or through the SES performance bonus process, as appropriate. NIST awards available to recognize exceptional authorship or editorship through the Incentive Awards Program include the Department of Commerce Gold and Silver Medal Awards, the NIST Edward Uhler Condon Award, the NIST Samuel W. Stratton Award, and the Special Act of Service Award.NIST recognizes the importance attached to authorship of scientific and technical publications. Under NIST policy, the decision to include a staff member as an author (or not) is usually made at the group level and is based on a truly substantial and professional contribution. Mere administrative supervision of the work is not a sufficient qualification for authorship. \u00a0\u00a0A key element of Scientific Integrity relating to scientific and technical research has to do with statements of uncertainty associated with measurement results. As the nation's primary Federal laboratory charged with advancing measurement science, standards, and technology, NIST has long recognized the critical role of rigorously applied uncertainty principles in the credibility of reported research, and especially of research that may underpin policy.According to long-standing published NIST policy, a measurement result is considered complete only when accompanied by a quantitative statement of its uncertainty. NIST policy requires uncertainty statements, and also requires that a uniform approach to expressing measurement uncertainty be followed. To ensure that uncertainty statements are consistent with each other and with international practice, the NIST policy adopts the approach to expressing measurement uncertainty recommended by the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM). \u00a0\u00a0In accordance with its policy regarding uncertainty statements, the NIST Manual specifically addresses Statements of Uncertainty Associated with Measurement Results. In addition, NIST's published Technical Note 1297, \"Guidelines for Evaluating and Expressing the Uncertainty of NIST Measurement Results,\" is made available without cost for the benefit of the scientific community and the general public.In addition, since 1959, the National Research Council (NRC) has assessed the technical merit, relevance, and quality of NIST's laboratory programs in the context of NIST's mission. The NRC review is independent, technically sophisticated, and extensive. Half of the NIST Laboratories are reviewed each year, which permits increased technical exchange between NIST scientists and the expert review panels (one for each of the NIST Laboratories). Each panel deliberates their findings in a closed session panel meeting and prepares a report summarizing its assessment findings. Panel members are selected by the NRC from leaders in industry, academia, non-profit organizations, and other federal agencies and government laboratories. The Laboratory Assessments Board of the National Academies oversees the NRC assessment activities. \u00a0\u00a0Typical reviews by NRC panels of NIST Laboratories include assessment of the degree to which NIST Laboratory programs in measurement science, standards, and services achieve their stated objectives and fulfill the mission of the NIST Operating Unit; assessment of the technical merits and scientific caliber of the current NIST Laboratory programs relative to comparable programs worldwide; and assessment of the alignment between NIST Laboratory R&amp;D efforts and those services and other mission critical deliverables for which that Laboratory is responsible.II. Public CommunicationsIt is the policy of NIST to comply with Departmental Administrative Order, DAO 219-1, with respect to its Public Communications. DAO 219-1 is available on the Department of Commerce's website at , and incorporated into the corresponding NIST Manual subchapter on Public Communications.III. Use of Federal Advisory CommitteesNIST has nine Federal Advisory Committees (FACs), of which five are tasked with giving technical and scientific advice. NIST's primary advisory committee, the Visiting Committee on Advanced Technology (VCAT), is charged to \"review and make recommendations regarding general policy for [NIST], its organization, its Budget, and its programs, within the framework of applicable national policies as set forth by the President and the Congress.\"The Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board (ISPAB), advises NIST, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \"on information security and privacy issues pertaining to Federal government information systems, including thorough review of proposed standards and guidelines developed by NIST.\"The Advisory Committee on Earthquake Hazards Reduction (ACEHR) acts in the public interest to advise NIST on trends and developments in the science and engineering of earthquake hazards reduction, the effectiveness of the NIST program in carrying out NIST's activities under section 103(a)(2) of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) Reauthorization Act of 2004, the need to revise the program, and the management, coordination, implementation, and activities of the Program.NIST's newest FAC, the NIST Smart Grid Advisory Committee (SGAP), provides input to NIST on Smart Grid \"standards, priorities and gaps,\" and on the overall direction, status and health of the Smart Grid implementation by the Smart Grid industry, including identification of issues and needs. SGAP input is used to help guide Smart Grid Interoperability Panel activities and also assist NIST in directing research and standards activities.NIST makes the recruitment process transparent for all of its FACs, soliciting public recommendations through its web site and through notice in the Federal Register2. NIST FAC member biographies are made available to the public through the pertinent NIST FAC web site (see, e.g., , which presents biographies for current VCAT members, and also lists all VCAT members since 1901).NIST FAC members are selected on a clear, standardized basis, in accordance with applicable Department of Commence guidance. Members of NIST FACs are selected on the basis of established records of distinguished service in their professional community and their knowledge of issues relevant to the FAC. Further, NIST makes every effort to selected FAC members such that the FAC will reflect the wide diversity of technical disciplines and competencies involved, and will come from a cross section of organizations.NIST will make Conflict of Interest waivers granted to NIST FAC members publicly available except when prohibited by law, and no NIST FAC reports, recommendations or products are subject to revision by NIST or any other agency of the Federal government.IV. Professional Development of Government Scientists and EngineersThe concept of professional development is part of the very fabric of NIST, reflected in everything from the agency's name, to the provisions of its enabling statute, to the NIST statement of Core Values:NIST's CORE VALUES:People: We value and support an inclusive, engaged, and diverse workforce capable of fulfilling the NIST mission.Integrity: We are objective, ethical, and honest.Customer focus: We anticipate the needs of our customers and are committed to meeting or exceeding their expectations.Excellence: We expect world-class performance and continuous improvement in all we do.NIST's Guest Researcher program brings literally thousands of scientists and engineers, from academia, industry and government, to the Institute to work side-by-side with NIST employees on cutting edge science. The NIST Graduate and Post-Doctoral Fellowship programs have brought many hundreds of young scientists, at the start of their careers, to the Gaithersburg and Boulder campuses. The NIST culture is, in large part, a culture premised on professional development.Publication in NIST technical publications and peer-reviewed scientific journals is considered in yearly performance evaluations of NIST scientists, who are encouraged to present the results of their research at professional meetings of their peers. NIST actively supports the participation of its scientists and engineers as members of editorial boards of professional and scholarly journals.NIST, consistent with Department of Commerce policy, allows its scientists and engineers to receive honors and awards for their research, counting among its ranks three Nobel Laureates in Physics3, a MacArthur Fellowship \"Genius Grant\" winner, a National Medal of Science winner, a number of members of the National Academies, and recipients of Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), the highest honor bestowed by the U.S. Government on science and engineering professionals in the early stages of their independent research careers. NIST actively supports its employees' participation in professional societies, committees, and task forces. Through its collaborations with academic institutions, NIST encourages its scientists and engineers to work actively with their professional colleagues, and NIST employees hold joint academic appointments through, for example, JILA with the University of Colorado, and the Joint Quantum Institute with the University of Maryland.NIST, along with NOAA, is working with the Department of Commerce to find ways, consistent with applicable laws, to reduce and remove barriers for its scientists and engineers to serve as officers or on governing boards of non-governmental non-profit organizations.\u00a012 See, e.g., NIST's July, 2010 \".\"3 In 2006, NIST's Nobel Prize Winners converged on the Hill to express to Congress their views on the importance to the nation of Science Policy: ,  and .<br /><br />Created June 03, 2016, Updated March 20, 2017<br /><br />HEADQUARTERS<br /><br />100 Bureau Drive<br /><br />Gaithersburg, MD 20899<br /><br />301-975-2000<br /><br />|  |How are we doing?<br /><br />", "publish_time": 1569735284083, "collection_time": 1569735284083, "summary": "Founded in 1901, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a non-regulatory federal agency within...", "source": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u5bb6\u6807\u51c6\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u9662"}

NIST's mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life. NIST carries out its mission through four cooperative programs: the NIST Laboratories, conducting research that advances that nation's technology infrastructure and is needed by U.S. industry to continually improve products and services; the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program, which promotes performance excellence among U.S. manufacturers, service companies, educational institutions, health care providers, and nonprofit organizations, conducts outreach programs, and manages the annual Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award which recognizes performance excellence and quality achievement; the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a nationwide network of local centers offering technical and business assistance to smaller manufacturers; and the Technology Innovation Program, which provides cost-shared technologies that address critical national and societal needs.In accordance with the Memorandum of December 17, 2010, from the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, NIST is currently working to update its relevant policies, including through revision of NIST Administrative Manual (NIST Manual), to more broadly address issues of Scientific Integrity. Relevant policies currently in effect are summarized below.I. \u00a0Foundation of Scientific Integrity in GovernmentNIST has in place a number of policies and procedures to ensure the integrity of the scientific and technological information it develops and disseminates to the public. Those policies and procedures include rigorous internal peer review of any published scientific and technological information.The NIST Manual sets forth policies and defines responsibilities that apply to the communication of NIST technical program results by staff members, guest researchers, research associates, and others who participate in the performance of NIST technical programs. Those NIST Manual policies and procedures explicitly apply to technical publications in all media including (but not limited to) hardcopy print media and machine-readable media (magnetic disk, magnetic tape, electronic storage devices, CD-ROM, and other forms of optical storage of information), and photographic film, as well as to all transmittals of new findings from NIST technical programs regardless of the means of communication, e.g., communication of new findings by telephone, telefax, direct electronic data transfer, videotape, or other special means.Thus, for example, the NIST Manual explains that all NIST technical communications are derived from the technical activities of its employees and supported by the technological records (e.g., research notebooks) they maintain. It is NIST policy that all NIST employees engaged in research and development activities are responsible for maintaining a thorough and accurate record of their work by keeping a research notebook following internal Operating Unit (OU) policies.Recognizing that scientific data at NIST are increasingly generated, stored and reported digitally, the NIST Leadership Board established a Scientific Data Lifecycle Management Working Group in December of 2009, to study the collection, storage, use, repurposing and preservation of NIST's digital scientific data. Composed of scientists and managers from across the Institute, the NIST Working Group was formed as a response to a report by the Interagency Working Group on Digital Data (IWGDD) operating under the Committee on Science of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC). The IWGDD report, entitled \"Harnessing the Power of Digital Data for Science and Society,\"1 called attention to the need for Federal research organizations to establish scientific data management policies, and underscored the risks of failing to do so. In carrying out its charter, the NIST Working Group also considered that the Administration has promoted a higher level of transparency, accessibility, and citizen engagement with the work products and operations of all Federal agencies. These factors served as the impetus to review and suggest improvements to NIST's management of digital data. The NIST Working Group is expected to issue its final report and recommendations in the second quarter of 2011.All official writing (as defined in Departmental Administrative Order DAO 219-1) must be reviewed by an internal Editorial Review Board, and approved for publication in accordance with procedures defined in the NIST Manual. The Editorial Review Boards at NIST are responsible for the final review and approval of all technical manuscripts produced by NIST.There are two NIST Editorial Review Boards, which are Standing Committees of NIST and are responsible to the Director: (1) The Washington Editorial Review Board (WERB) is responsible for the review and approval of technical manuscripts prepared by authors and coauthors at Gaithersburg; and (2) The Boulder Editorial Review Board (BERB) is responsible for the review and approval of technical manuscripts prepared by authors and coauthors at Boulder. All NIST technical manuscripts must be reviewed and approved by the responsible division chief with the originating OU before the manuscript is submitted to the appropriate NIST editorial Review Board.According to the NIST Manual, Editorial Review Board decisions that do not approve publications are accompanied by recommendations to the author(s) that, if accepted, will result in approval; if such recommendations are not accepted, the authors may seek resolution of the issues through direct discussions with the Chairperson of the Editorial Review Board. After all other remedies have been exhausted, the Editorial Review Board decision may be appealed through the responsible OU Director to the NIST Director. If a decision by an Editorial Review Board is overruled by the NIST Director, the Editorial Review Board must be informed.The NIST Manual also contemplates that NIST employees may publish \"nonofficial\" manuscripts subject to prior review to ensure that the government has neither proprietary nor regulatory interest.The NIST Manual expresses NIST policy to strive to publish openly, widely, and promptly the results of all technical programs. Therefore, it is noted that agreements to perform technical work for other organizations (which would include other Federal agencies) must include a provision that addresses the publication of such results either by NIST or by the sponsoring organization, and that any provision for the delay of publication beyond three months after the completion of the technical work, or any provision that would otherwise limit publication, requires the approval of the responsible NIST OU Director.Under NIST Policy, NIST reports of work sponsored by other Federal agencies, regardless of the form they take or the media used, are subject to the same quality control requirements as all other technical reports of NIST. These requirements include the procedures for review and approval specified in the NIST Manual.NIST affirmatively encourages excellence in published research through the performance payout process of the NIST Personnel Management Demonstration Project or through the SES performance bonus process, as appropriate. NIST awards available to recognize exceptional authorship or editorship through the Incentive Awards Program include the Department of Commerce Gold and Silver Medal Awards, the NIST Edward Uhler Condon Award, the NIST Samuel W. Stratton Award, and the Special Act of Service Award.NIST recognizes the importance attached to authorship of scientific and technical publications. Under NIST policy, the decision to include a staff member as an author (or not) is usually made at the group level and is based on a truly substantial and professional contribution. Mere administrative supervision of the work is not a sufficient qualification for authorship. \u00a0\u00a0A key element of Scientific Integrity relating to scientific and technical research has to do with statements of uncertainty associated with measurement results. As the nation's primary Federal laboratory charged with advancing measurement science, standards, and technology, NIST has long recognized the critical role of rigorously applied uncertainty principles in the credibility of reported research, and especially of research that may underpin policy.According to long-standing published NIST policy, a measurement result is considered complete only when accompanied by a quantitative statement of its uncertainty. NIST policy requires uncertainty statements, and also requires that a uniform approach to expressing measurement uncertainty be followed. To ensure that uncertainty statements are consistent with each other and with international practice, the NIST policy adopts the approach to expressing measurement uncertainty recommended by the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM). \u00a0\u00a0In accordance with its policy regarding uncertainty statements, the NIST Manual specifically addresses Statements of Uncertainty Associated with Measurement Results. In addition, NIST's published Technical Note 1297, \"Guidelines for Evaluating and Expressing the Uncertainty of NIST Measurement Results,\" is made available without cost for the benefit of the scientific community and the general public.In addition, since 1959, the National Research Council (NRC) has assessed the technical merit, relevance, and quality of NIST's laboratory programs in the context of NIST's mission. The NRC review is independent, technically sophisticated, and extensive. Half of the NIST Laboratories are reviewed each year, which permits increased technical exchange between NIST scientists and the expert review panels (one for each of the NIST Laboratories). Each panel deliberates their findings in a closed session panel meeting and prepares a report summarizing its assessment findings. Panel members are selected by the NRC from leaders in industry, academia, non-profit organizations, and other federal agencies and government laboratories. The Laboratory Assessments Board of the National Academies oversees the NRC assessment activities. \u00a0\u00a0Typical reviews by NRC panels of NIST Laboratories include assessment of the degree to which NIST Laboratory programs in measurement science, standards, and services achieve their stated objectives and fulfill the mission of the NIST Operating Unit; assessment of the technical merits and scientific caliber of the current NIST Laboratory programs relative to comparable programs worldwide; and assessment of the alignment between NIST Laboratory R&amp;D efforts and those services and other mission critical deliverables for which that Laboratory is responsible.II.

The steps in the process are direction, collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination.<br /><br />IC products can either be based on a single type of collection or \u201call-source,\u201d that is, based upon all available types of collection. IC products also can be produced by one IC element or coordinated with other IC elements, and delivered to IC customers in various formats, including papers, digital media, briefings, maps, graphics, videos, and other distribution methods.<br /><br />There are six basic intelligence sources, or collection disciplines:<br /><br />SIGINT\u2014Signals intelligence is derived from signal intercepts comprising -- however transmitted -- either individually or in combination: all communications intelligence (COMINT), electronic intelligence (ELINT) and foreign instrumentation signals intelligence (FISINT).The National Security Agency is responsible for collecting, processing, and reporting SIGINT. The National SIGINT Committee within NSA advises the Director, NSA, and the DNI on SIGINT policy issues and manages the SIGINT requirements system.<br /><br />IMINT\u2014Imagery Intelligence includes representations of objects reproduced electronically or by optical means on film, electronic display devices, or other media. Imagery can be derived from visual photography, radar sensors, and electro-optics.NGA is the manager for all imagery intelligence activities, both classified and unclassified, within the government, including requirements, collection, processing, exploitation, dissemination, archiving, and retrieval.<br /><br />MASINT\u2014Measurement and Signature Intelligence is technically derived intelligence data other than imagery and SIGINT. The data results in intelligence that locates, identifies, or describes distinctive characteristics of targets. It employs a broad group of disciplines including nuclear, optical, radio frequency, acoustics, seismic, and materials sciences.Examples of this might be the distinctive radar signatures of specific aircraft systems or the chemical composition of air and water samples. The Directorate for MASINT and Technical Collection (DT), a component of the Defense Intelligence Agency, is the focus for all national and Department of Defense MASINT matters.<br /><br />HUMINT\u2014Human intelligence is derived from human sources. To the public, HUMINT remains synonymous with espionage and clandestine activities; however, most of HUMINT collection is performed by overt collectors such as strategic debriefers and military attaches. It is the oldest method for collecting information, and until the technical revolution of the mid- to late20th century, it was the primary source of intelligence.<br /><br />OSINT\u2014Open-Source Intelligence is publicly available information appearing in print or electronic form including radio, television, newspapers, journals, the Internet, commercial databases, and videos, graphics, and drawings. While open-source collection responsibilities are broadly distributed through the IC, the major collectors are the DNI's Open Source Center (OSC) and the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC).<br /><br />GEOINT\u2014Geospatial Intelligence is the analysis and visual representation of security related activities on the earth. It is produced through an integration of imagery, imagery intelligence, and geospatial information.<br /><br />The National Intelligence Strategy<br /><br />In support of the National Security Strategy, which sets forth national security priorities, the  (NIS) provides the IC with the mission direction of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) for the next four to five years. IC activities must be consistent with, and responsive to, national security priorities and must comply with the Constitution, applicable statutes, and Congressional oversight requirements. The NIS should be read along with the National Intelligence Priorities Framework and Unifying Intelligence Strategies to inform and guide mission, as well as planning, programming, and budgeting activities.<br /><br />The NIS describes sevenMission Objectives that broadly describe the priority outputs needed to deliver timely, insightful, objective, and relevant intelligence to our customers. Intelligence includes foreign intelligence and counterintelligence. The Mission Objectives are designed to address the totality of regional and functional issues facing the IC; their prioritization is communicated to the IC through the National Intelligence Priorities Framework:<br /><br />Three Mission Objectives refer to foundational intelligence missions the IC must accomplish, regardless of threat or topic:<br /><br />Strategic Intelligence\u2014inform and enrich understanding of enduring national security issues;<br /><br />Anticipatory Intelligence\u2014detect, identify, and warn of emerging issues and discontinuities;<br /><br />Current Operations\u2014support ongoing actions and sensitive intelligence operations.<br /><br />Four Mission Objectives identify the primary topical missions the IC must accomplish:<br /><br />Cyber Intelligence\u2014provide intelligence on cyber threats;<br /><br />Counterterrorism\u2014understand and counter those involved in terrorism and related activities;<br /><br />Counterproliferation\u2014counter the threat and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction;<br /><br />Counterintelligence\u2014thwart efforts of foreign intelligence entities.<br /><br />Related Links<br /><br />ODNI Centers<br /><br />ODNI Offices<br /><br />Information<br /><br />Useful Links<br /><br />", "publish_time": 1569735010889, "collection_time": 1569735010889, "summary": "Mission Lead Intelligence Integration Forge an Intelligence Community that delivers the most insightful intelligence possible.

No Class ReliefThis Section 26 is deemed to be a \u201cwritten agreement to<br /><br />arbitrate\u201d pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and NBCUniversal agree that we intend that this Section 26 satisfies the \u201cwriting\u201d<br /><br />requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Section 26 can only be amended by<br /><br />mutual agreement. For non-U.S. residents, if binding arbitration is adjudged by<br /><br />a tribunal to be unenforceable, the provisions of Section 27 shall apply to all<br /><br />relevant disputes between you and us. We believe<br /><br />that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive way to resolve<br /><br />any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us. Therefore, pursuant to these Terms of<br /><br />Service, if you have any dispute or disagreement with us regarding (i) your use<br /><br />of or interaction with the Site or other online services, (ii) any purchases or<br /><br />other transactions or relationships with NBCUniversal, or<br /><br />(iii) any data or information you may provide to NBCUniversal or that NBCUniversal may gather in connection with such use,<br /><br />interaction or transaction (collectively, \u201cNBCUniversal Transactions or Relationships\u201d), you will<br /><br />not have the right to pursue a claim in court, or have a jury decide the claim<br /><br />and you will not have the right to bring or participate in any class action or<br /><br />similar proceeding in court or in arbitration. By using or interacting with the Site or<br /><br />other online service, or engaging in any other NBCUniversal Transactions or Relationships with us, you<br /><br />agree to binding arbitration as provided below.We will<br /><br />make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints, disputes, or<br /><br />disagreements that you may have with us.<br /><br />If those efforts fail, by using our Site or other online service, you<br /><br />agree that any complaint, dispute, or disagreement you may have against NBCUniversal, and any claim that NBCUniversal may have against you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any<br /><br />way with these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, or any NBCUniversal Transactions or Relationships shall be<br /><br />resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d)<br /><br />administered by JAMS or its successor (\u201cJAMS\u201d) and conducted in accordance with<br /><br />the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules And Procedures in effect at the time the<br /><br />Arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, in<br /><br />accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules And Procedures then in<br /><br />effect (respectively, the \u201cApplicable Rules\u201d). The Applicable Rules can be found at www.jamsadr.com.<br /><br />If JAMS is no longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered<br /><br />by the American Arbitration Association or its successor (the \u201cAAA\u201d) instead,<br /><br />and conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect<br /><br />at that time (which shall be the \u201cApplicable Rules\u201d in such circumstances). If JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) at the<br /><br />time the arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for<br /><br />Consumer Arbitrations in effect which would be applicable to the matter in<br /><br />dispute, NBCUniversal agrees to<br /><br />provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are<br /><br />more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth in this Section<br /><br />26, provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene<br /><br />or restrict the application of subpart (e) or (i) below. Furthermore, this Section 26 shall not<br /><br />prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from<br /><br />a court of appropriate jurisdiction.<br /><br />You further agree that: (a)<br /><br />Single Arbitrator. The Arbitration shall be conducted before<br /><br />a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the Applicable Rules or by<br /><br />mutual agreement between you and NBCUniversal (the<br /><br />\u201cArbitrator\u201d);(b)<br /><br />Arbitrator Will Interpret This Agreement. The Arbitrator, and not any federal,<br /><br />state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve<br /><br />any dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation,<br /><br />applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service and/or<br /><br />these arbitration provisions in Section 26 hereof, including but not limited to<br /><br />any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service is void or voidable;(c)<br /><br />Location of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be held either:<br /><br />(i) at a location determined by JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) pursuant to the<br /><br />Applicable Rules (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you<br /><br />and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of<br /><br />business); or (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you<br /><br />and NBCUniversal; or (iii) at your election, if the only<br /><br />claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than $10,000 in<br /><br />aggregate, by telephone or by written submission.(d)<br /><br />Governing Law. The Arbitrator (i) shall apply<br /><br />internal laws of the State of New York consistent with the Federal<br /><br />Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, or, to the extent (if any) that<br /><br />federal law prevails, shall apply the law of the U.S., irrespective of any<br /><br />conflict of law principles; (ii) shall entertain any motion to dismiss, motion<br /><br />to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial<br /><br />summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive<br /><br />motion consistent with New York or federal rules of procedure, as applicable;<br /><br />(iii) shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and<br /><br />(iv) shall have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;(e)<br /><br />NoClass Relief. The<br /><br />Arbitration can resolve only your and/or NBCUniversal\u2019s individual claims, and the<br /><br />Arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain or arbitrate any claims on a<br /><br />class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other<br /><br />persons or parties who may be similarly situated;(f)<br /><br />Written Award The Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a<br /><br />statement of decision setting forth the Arbitrator\u2019s complete determination of<br /><br />the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an<br /><br />\u201cAward\u201d). Judgment upon the Award<br /><br />may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction<br /><br />over the relevant party or its assets;(g)<br /><br />Arbitration<br /><br />Costs. In the event<br /><br />that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of Arbitration will be<br /><br />prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, NBCUniversal will pay as<br /><br />much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the Arbitration as the<br /><br />Arbitrator deems necessary to<br /><br />prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome<br /><br />of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were<br /><br />frivolous or asserted in bad faith;(h)<br /><br />Reasonable Attorney\u2019s Fees. In the event you recover an Award<br /><br />greater than NBCUniversal\u2019s last<br /><br />written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right to include<br /><br />in the Award NBCUniversal\u2019s<br /><br />reimbursement of your reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneys\u2019 fees<br /><br />associated with the Arbitration, but NBCUniversal shall in all events bear its own<br /><br />attorneys\u2019 fees; and (i)<br /><br />Interpretation<br /><br />and Enforcement of Arbitration Clause. With the exception of subpart (e) above,<br /><br />if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid,<br /><br />unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules,<br /><br />then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall<br /><br />be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable,<br /><br />illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however,<br /><br />subpart (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety<br /><br />of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor NBCUniversal shall be<br /><br />entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring any claims in a<br /><br />court of competent jurisdiction.(j)<br /><br />Modification<br /><br />of Arbitration Clause With Notice. NBCUniversal may modify these arbitration<br /><br />provisions, but such modifications shall only become effective thirty (30) days<br /><br />after NBCUniversal has<br /><br />given notice of such modifications and only on a prospective basis for claims<br /><br />arising from NBCUniversal<br /><br />Transactions and Relationships occurring after the effective date of such<br /><br />notification.(k)<br /><br />SmallClaims Matters are Excluded. No<br /><br />Class Relief or Joinder of Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing<br /><br />arbitration provisions, at your option, you may bring any claim you have<br /><br />against NBCUniversal in your local small claims court within the<br /><br />U.S., if your claim is within such court\u2019s jurisdictional limit; provided that<br /><br />such court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a<br /><br />class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other<br /><br />persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such proceeding.<br /><br />27.Dispute Resolution for Non-US<br /><br />Residents Only if a Tribunal has Ruled that Arbitration is Prohibited by LawThis Section 27 applies to non-US<br /><br />Residents, where applicable law prohibits arbitration of disputes in accordance<br /><br />with Section 26.

It calls his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani a &quot;central figure&quot; in the effort and says Attorney General William Barr &quot;appears to be involved as well.&quot;Concerns that the document would show Trump trying to get a foreign state to investigate one of his chief political rivals \u2014 and accusations that the White House improperly stonewalled efforts to see it \u2014 led House Democrats to accuse the president of abusing his power. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday that the chamber would start impeachment proceedings into Trump.  she said Trump &quot;betrayed&quot; his oath of office and accused the White House of a &quot;cover-up.&quot;Shortly after the document&#x27;s release, Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified about the complaint at the House Intelligence Committee. Members of congressional intelligence panels had a chance to review the document Wednesday.In a statement Thursday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said, &quot;Nothing has changed with the release of this complaint, which is nothing more than a collection of third-hand accounts of events and cobbled-together press clippings\u2014all of which shows nothing improper.&quot; She said the president released a memorandum summarizing the call Wednesday &quot;because he has nothing to hide.&quot;&quot;The White House will continue to push back on the hysteria and false narratives being peddled by Democrats and many in the main stream media, and President Trump will continue to work hard on behalf of the American people as he always does,&quot; she said.VIDEO4:1504:15Trump addresses questions about Ukraine amid calls for impeachmentA spokeswoman for Giuliani did not immediately respond to CNBC&#x27;s request to comment. The president&#x27;s attorney  in the complaint.Department of Justice officials in the agency&#x27;s criminal division concluded that the July call did not constitute a campaign finance violation, NBC News reported Wednesday. That division determined last week that Trump&#x27;s request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not amount to a &quot;thing of value&quot; as the law requires, an official told NBC.The complaint from the whistleblower, who remains anonymous, has three main sections: &quot;The 25 July Presidential phone call,&quot; &quot;efforts to restrict access to records related to the call&quot; and &quot;ongoing concerns.&quot;The administration&#x27;s summary of the call between Trump and Zelensky showed  former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. He also suggested the Ukrainian government should cooperate with Giuliani and Barr.Trump also asked Zelensky for a vague &quot;favor&quot; related to cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike and an unspecific &quot;server.&quot; The Democratic National Committee used Crowdstrike to investigate 2016 cyberattacks. It ultimately concluded Russia was responsible for the hacks.In the complaint, the whistleblower writes that Trump &quot;sought to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take actions to help the President&#x27;s 2020 reelection bid.&quot; After summarizing the phone call, the person continued:The White House officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call. They told me that there was already a &quot;discussion ongoing&quot; with White House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in the officials&#x27; retelling, that they had witnessed the President abuse his office for personal gain.&#x27;Lock down&#x27; all recordsThe whistleblower goes on to write that &quot;I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to &#x27;lock down&#x27; all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced- as is customary-by the White House Situation Room.&quot; The person writes that officials said White House lawyers &quot;directed&quot; them to pull the electronic transcript of the call from the computer system where it is typically stored and put into into a &quot;separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature.&quot;&quot;One White House official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective,&quot; the author of the complaint writes.The whistleblower also writes that White House officials said it was &quot;not the first time&quot; the administration protected a presidential transcript in that manner even though it did not contain information sensitive to national security.The complaint adds that the whistleblower did not know whether the White House took other measures to restrict access to other records of the call such as handwritten notes.The document outlines other concerns, including a meeting between U.S. officials and Zelensky and his advisors that took place a day after Trump&#x27;s call with the Ukrainian leader, a comedian who was elected in April. Trump&#x27;s special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, and U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland gave the Ukrainian government advice on how to &quot;navigate&quot; Trump&#x27;s demands, the whistleblower writes, citing multiple readouts recounted by various U.S. officials.The complaint also says Giuliani met with one of Zelensky&#x27;s advisors in Madrid on Aug. 2 in what is described as a &quot;direct follow-up&quot; to Trump&#x27;s call with the Ukrainian president.Trump&#x27;s actions related to Ukraine have put his presidency in its most serious jeopardy yet, after he survived the probe by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election and his alleged efforts to obstruct the investigation. As concerns mount about the call, Trump has repeatedly called it &quot;perfect&quot; and said he did not pressure Zelensky.Trump allies have seized on the fact that the call summary did not appear to show a direct quid pro quo related to U.S. aid to Ukraine. Multiple outlets reported that Trump told his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to withhold nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine before his July 25 call with Zelensky.Speaking at the hearing with Maguire, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., characterized Trump&#x27;s call with Zelensky as a &quot;classic organized-crime shakedown.&quot; The top Republican on the panel, Rep. Devin Nunes of California, called the concerns about the president&#x27;s conduct Democratic &quot;information warfare against the president.&quot;Not all Republicans who viewed the complaint felt the same as Nunes, a Trump ally who had to recuse himself from the Russia probe. Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, for example, said &quot;there is a lot in the whistleblower complaint that is concerning.&quot;&quot;We need to fully investigate all of the allegations addressed in the letter, and the first step is to talk to the whistleblower,&quot; Hurd, who is retiring at the end of his term, tweeted on Thursday.Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican and member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Wednesday that he saw &quot;really troubling things&quot; in the complaint.&quot;Republicans ought not just circle the wagons and Democrats ought not have been using words like impeachment before they knew anything about the actual substance,&quot; he said.\u2014 CNBC&#x27;s Kevin Breuninger contributed to this reportRelated TagsTrending NowNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Cybercrooks are still after your crown jewels, warns NCSC<br /><br />GCHQ offshoot says be on your guard<br /><br />By18Sep2019at19:00<br /><br />Cybercrims are still likely to affect universities and other educational institutions online with ransomware, reckons GCHQ offshoot the National Cyber Security Centre.<br /><br />Attacks by online criminals and nation states alike are \"rising\", the NCSC warned in a report .<br /><br />Sarah Lyons, deputy director for economy and society at the British security centre, said: \"NCSC is working closely with the academic sector to ensure that, wherever the threat comes from, they are able to protect their research and their universities in cyberspace.\"<br /><br />While cybercriminals are most likely to deploy ransomware and other nasties \"through untargeted attacks\", the impact of their nefarious deeds is generally more than trivial. Attackers, said the NCSC, are generally quite likely to succeed because they exploit the \"open and outward facing\" nature of academic institutions.<br /><br />\"Using sources such as a university's website, it is straightforward to identify who to target, how to reach them, and to establish a credible story with which to approach them,\" said the NCSC.<br /><br />Phishy story<br /><br />They're not alone in highlighting the risk from phishing: back in April, academic infosec bods from Jisc, formerly known as the Joint Information Systems Committee, warned that a pen-test exercise had seen them .<br /><br />Aside from organised crime and thieves looking to pick a cyber-pocket through the use of cyber-tools in the cyber-domain, British universities also need to be on the lookout for state-backed threats as well.<br /><br />\"Cyber,\" opined NCSC, \"offers a deniable route to obtain information that is otherwise unavailable to them. It is likely exploited instead of, or in conjunction with, traditional routes to gain access to research, such as partnering, 'seconded students', or direct investment.\"<br /><br />Last year, an Iranian campaign to steal login credentials from Western universities was . The scam played on the old technique of setting up fake login pages to man-in-the-middle the victims' credentials for academic repositories.<br /><br />\"Many of the fake pages were linked to university library systems, indicating the actors' appetite for this type of material,\" the NCSC said of the Iranians' doings.<br /><br />Once inside, state-backed hackers normally go for information of high commercial or military value, NCSC warned.<br /><br />Bulk personal data, technical information, sensitive research and intellectual property are all types of information that attackers of both broad flavours are interested in \u2013 and should therefore be defended accordingly.<br /><br />AttacksNot all attacks are known or traceable. The University of Edinburgh was , while King's College London (no stranger to IT woes) suffered what appears to be .<br /><br />Defending against these kinds of attacks is a combination of the usual methods: train people, staff and students alike, in what a suspicious approach looks like, deploy multi-factor authentication to make it harder for remote attackers to log in, and take a good look at your institution's network architecture and internal controls.<br /><br />\"We believe that state espionage will continue to pose the most significant threat to the long-term health of both universities and the UK itself,\" concluded the NCSC. \"There's a realistic possibility that the threat will increase in-line with increased scrutiny of foreign direct investment and the minimising of other avenues to gain insight and advantage.\" \u00ae<br /><br />Sponsored:Tips and corrections<br /><br />MOREMost readMore from The Register<br /><br />Sponsored links<br /><br />ABOUT USMORE CONTENT<br /><br />SITUATION PUBLISHING<br /><br />The Register - Independent news and views for the tech community.

Many were not live but were still in their testing phase when we suspended them.\"<br /><br />Some, including Oregon's tech-savvy Democratic Senator \"Silicon\" Ron Wyden, weren't particularly impressed.<br /><br />Sen. : \"This wasn\u2019t some accident. Facebook put up a neon sign that said \u2018Free Private Data,\u2019 and let app developers have their fill of Americans\u2019 personal info. The FTC needs to hold Mark Zuckerberg personally responsible\"  w/<br /><br />\u2014 Drew Harwell (@drewharwell)<br /><br />ESET details Stealth Falcon backdoor<br /><br />Researchers with ESET this week introduced a newly discovered backdoor being used with the Falcon hacking operation.<br /><br />The backdoor is notable in that it uses a little-known function in Windows called BITS (background intelligent transfer services) to quietly handle communications between the infected machines and the command and control servers.<br /><br />\"Compared to traditional communication via API functions, the BITS mechanism is exposed through a COM interface and thus is harder to detect,\" ESET explained.<br /><br />\"Moreover, this design is reliable and stealthy, and more likely to be permitted by host firewalls.\"<br /><br />It is an attack you most likely will never face. The Stealth Falcon attacks have been primarily looking to infect political activists and journalists operating out of the Middle East.<br /><br />Still, if you want a more detailed look into a very interesting piece of malware, ESET's full report can be read .<br /><br />Windows NTFS prone to file-guessing bug<br /><br />One bug not addressed in this month's Patch Tuesday bundle was this file enumeration error in the Windows NT File System.<br /><br />Researcher John \"hyp3rlinx\" Page  that anyone with an ordinary user account on a drive using NTFS could potentially take advantage of a quirk in the error reporting system of Windows to figure out what protected files are on a machine.<br /><br />\"Standard account users attempting to open another users files or folders that do not contain a valid extension or dot '.' in its filename are always issued the expected 'Access is denied' system error message,\" Page explained.<br /><br />\"However, for files that contain a (dot) in the filename and that also don't exist, the system echoes the following attacker friendly warning: 'The system cannot find the file'.\"<br /><br />\"This error message inconsistency allows attackers to infer files EXIST, because any other time we would get 'The system cannot find the file'.\"<br /><br />While the flaw could be useful to hackers performing recon by trying to map out what files are on a machine and where, it wasn't quite severe enough to qualify as a security vulnerability in Microsoft's book and Page was told his discovery \"does not meet the bar for security servicing.\"<br /><br />Online pizza order ends in SWAT team call<br /><br />A prankster looking to pull a fast one may have gotten  (or perhaps exactly what they wanted) when a phony message hidden within a pizza order ended in a massive police incident.<br /><br />A Domino's Pizza shop in San Diego received a seemingly normal mobile order on September 10, until one of the employees noticed that someone had put a message into the order claiming that a person was being held hostage at the pizza's destination (a home in nearby Sherman Heights.)<br /><br />This led the outlet to notify the police, who sent officers in tactical gear to clear out and search the home. They eventually concluded the call was a hoax and the people at the house had no idea what was going on.<br /><br />No word on whether they got the pizza.<br /><br />US-CERT dissects new North Korean malware<br /><br />The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) has said it has a new sample of malware appearing to have originated in North Korea.  \"Badcall\" and \"Electricfish\", the malware is believed to be the work of the Hidden Cobra hacking operation campaign that has sought to plunder cash to funnel in to North Korea.<br /><br />Suspected \"hack\" was a Fortnite update<br /><br />Security writer Stilgherrian uncovered  from the 2018 Commonwealth games: days before the games were set to start, admins noticed an unusually high spike in network traffic and figured someone was attacking the event's network with a DDoS flood.<br /><br />As it turned out, the spike was actually just nearby users downloading a larger-than-usual update to the MMO shooter Fortnite, both a testament to the popularity of the game at the time and the interesting traffic patterns it generated.<br /><br />Researcher uncovers Uber security hole<br /><br />AppSecure  a flaw it discovered in Uber that could have potentially allowed a determined attacker to hijack a user's account.<br /><br />It turns out the API Uber uses to handle the Uber user ID (UUID) numbers is insecure. An attacker who was able to get the user's phone number or email address could create an API request that would return the UUID.

The Stealth Falcon attacks have been primarily looking to infect political activists and journalists operating out of the Middle East.<br /><br />Still, if you want a more detailed look into a very interesting piece of malware, ESET's full report can be read .<br /><br />Windows NTFS prone to file-guessing bug<br /><br />One bug not addressed in this month's Patch Tuesday bundle was this file enumeration error in the Windows NT File System.<br /><br />Researcher John \"hyp3rlinx\" Page  that anyone with an ordinary user account on a drive using NTFS could potentially take advantage of a quirk in the error reporting system of Windows to figure out what protected files are on a machine.<br /><br />\"Standard account users attempting to open another users files or folders that do not contain a valid extension or dot '.' in its filename are always issued the expected 'Access is denied' system error message,\" Page explained.<br /><br />\"However, for files that contain a (dot) in the filename and that also don't exist, the system echoes the following attacker friendly warning: 'The system cannot find the file'.\"<br /><br />\"This error message inconsistency allows attackers to infer files EXIST, because any other time we would get 'The system cannot find the file'.\"<br /><br />While the flaw could be useful to hackers performing recon by trying to map out what files are on a machine and where, it wasn't quite severe enough to qualify as a security vulnerability in Microsoft's book and Page was told his discovery \"does not meet the bar for security servicing.\"<br /><br />Online pizza order ends in SWAT team call<br /><br />A prankster looking to pull a fast one may have gotten  (or perhaps exactly what they wanted) when a phony message hidden within a pizza order ended in a massive police incident.<br /><br />A Domino's Pizza shop in San Diego received a seemingly normal mobile order on September 10, until one of the employees noticed that someone had put a message into the order claiming that a person was being held hostage at the pizza's destination (a home in nearby Sherman Heights.)<br /><br />This led the outlet to notify the police, who sent officers in tactical gear to clear out and search the home. They eventually concluded the call was a hoax and the people at the house had no idea what was going on.<br /><br />No word on whether they got the pizza.<br /><br />US-CERT dissects new North Korean malware<br /><br />The United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) has said it has a new sample of malware appearing to have originated in North Korea.  \"Badcall\" and \"Electricfish\", the malware is believed to be the work of the Hidden Cobra hacking operation campaign that has sought to plunder cash to funnel in to North Korea.<br /><br />Suspected \"hack\" was a Fortnite update<br /><br />Security writer Stilgherrian uncovered  from the 2018 Commonwealth games: days before the games were set to start, admins noticed an unusually high spike in network traffic and figured someone was attacking the event's network with a DDoS flood.<br /><br />As it turned out, the spike was actually just nearby users downloading a larger-than-usual update to the MMO shooter Fortnite, both a testament to the popularity of the game at the time and the interesting traffic patterns it generated.<br /><br />Researcher uncovers Uber security hole<br /><br />AppSecure  a flaw it discovered in Uber that could have potentially allowed a determined attacker to hijack a user's account.<br /><br />It turns out the API Uber uses to handle the Uber user ID (UUID) numbers is insecure. An attacker who was able to get the user's phone number or email address could create an API request that would return the UUID.

Potential penalties for the offences range from two to 20 years in prison.<br /><br />Gunton (AKA \"Planet\") \u2013 along with co-defendant Anthony Tyler Nashatka of New York (AKA \"Psycho\") \u2013 is accused of accessing cryptocurrency exchange EtherDelta and emptying user accounts. No total figure for the fraud is given  (PDF), but one account lost about $800,000. The alleged offences date back to 2017.<br /><br />The indictment claims that the two used a variety of techniques to get access to EtherDelta's hosting account on Cloudflare. This included redirecting phone calls to a Google Voice account in order to access two-factor authentication checks, the document says.<br /><br />They then allegedly accessed Cloudflare systems and redirected the DNS settings to an IP address registered to a UK company. By setting up a fake EtherDelta website, they could then access complete account details whenever a customer attempted to log in. These details could then be used to access and empty the actual customer accounts.<br /><br />Elliott Gunton was in court in Norwich last month, .<br /><br />Gunton accessed Australian telco Telstra's systems to seize control of an Instagram account with more than a million followers. At the time of his arrest, police found a Bitcoin wallet containing more than \u00a3400,000 in the cryptocurrency earned from flogging account details on cybercrime forums. He was ordered to hand that money to police.<br /><br />He was also found to be in breach of his Sexual Harms Prevention Order (SHPO) after cops found a copy of a disk cleaner and deletion tool on his laptop. SHPOs normally include a condition that prevents suspects from deleting any internet history so police can easily monitor compliance. Indecent images of children were found on his computer when the then 16-year-old was convicted of the TalkTalk attack in 2016.<br /><br />Although he was sentenced to 20 months, he was immediately released due to time served on remand. He was also served with a three-and-a-half-year community order restricting his internet and software use. \u00ae<br /><br />Sponsored:Tips and corrections<br /><br />MOREMost readMore from The Register<br /><br />Sponsored links<br /><br />ABOUT USMORE CONTENT<br /><br />SITUATION PUBLISHING<br /><br />The Register - Independent news and views for the tech community.

He was sentenced this afternoon.<br /><br />Donchev, originally from the city of Pleven, created what prosecutors described as \"phishing protection scripts\" to be embedded on cloned websites of legitimate companies. The clones were then hosted on a server controlled by other criminals who would lure victims in by sending phishing emails.<br /><br />\"Donchev would not steal the bank details himself,\" said specialist prosecutor Sarah Jennings. \"He would supply the tools for others to do so.

Cops estimated there were a potential half-a-million victims as a result of his criminal activity, with the fraud totalling \u00a341.6m.<br /><br />Donchev pleaded guilty to: making articles for use in fraud; supplying articles for use in fraud; encouraging the commission of an offence; concealing/disguising/transferring/removing criminal property (in that he received Bitcoin as payment for his criminal deeds); and acquiring criminal property, namely 1.5257417 Bitcoin. His sentence was a mixture of concurrent and consecutive prison terms totalling nine years.<br /><br />Under current sentencing laws Donchev will spend a maximum of four-and-a-half years in prison.

In addition to creating these teams, the bill will authorize spending to bring in private companies when needed.<br /><br />The teams' duties will include assisting agencies in recovering from attacks and outages, risk assessment and threat mitigation, and developing recommendations and best practices for network and data security at various DHS offices.<br /><br />\"This bipartisan legislation will allow the best minds in cybersecurity to work together to better protect our digital infrastructure and to respond to attacks,\" Hassan said after the bill passed.<br /><br />\"I am pleased that this commonsense bill passed the Senate, and I urge my colleagues in the House to pass it without delay.\"<br /><br />FBI, NSA to hackers: Let us be blunt.

In at least two of the cases, the hackers ended up being able to navigate the provider's network with domain admin clearance, we're told.<br /><br />This means the snoops would be able to not only access everything on the IT provider's network, but also create additional accounts and remotely control machines, potentially.<br /><br />The Symantec team noted the attackers used some of the same malware as the Iran-based  cyber-espionage group, though we've been cautioned against drawing any connections, as those tools have been in the public domain since they were leaked in April.<br /><br />Because it was the service providers that were infected, Symantec can't say who the ultimate targets were, and there is of yet no way to definitively connect the attack to any group or nation. \u00ae<br /><br />Sponsored:Tips and corrections<br /><br />MOREMost readMore from The Register<br /><br />Sponsored links<br /><br />ABOUT USMORE CONTENT<br /><br />SITUATION PUBLISHING<br /><br />The Register - Independent news and views for the tech community.

Physicists calculated how many hacked, stalled connected cars would cause how much mayhem.<br /><br />Share:FULL STORYIn the year 2026, at rush hour, your self-driving car abruptly shuts down right where it blocks traffic. You climb out to see gridlock down every street in view, then a news alert on your watch tells you that hackers have paralyzed all Manhattan traffic by randomly stranding internet-connected cars.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />Flashback to July 2019, the dawn of autonomous vehicles and other connected cars, and physicists at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Multiscale Systems, Inc. have applied physics in a new study to simulate what it would take for future hackers to wreak exactly this widespread havoc by randomly stranding these cars. The researchers want to expand the current discussion on automotive cybersecurity, which mainly focuses on hacks that could crash one car or run over one pedestrian, to include potential mass mayhem.<br /><br />They warn that even with increasingly tighter cyber defenses, the amount of data breached has soared in the past four years, but objects becoming hackable can convert the rising cyber threat into a potential physical menace.<br /><br />\"Unlike most of the data breaches we hear about, hacked cars have physical consequences,\" said Peter Yunker, who co-led the study and is an assistant professor in Georgia Tech's School of Physics.<br /><br />It may not be that hard for state, terroristic, or mischievous actors to commandeer parts of the internet of things, including cars.<br /><br />\"With cars, one of the worrying things is that currently there is effectively one central computing system, and a lot runs through it. You don't necessarily have separate systems to run your car and run your satellite radio. If you can get into one, you may be able to get into the other,\" said Jesse Silverberg of Multiscale Systems, Inc., who co-led the study with Yunker.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />Freezing traffic solid<br /><br />In simulations of hacking internet-connected cars, the researchers froze traffic in Manhattan nearly solid, and it would not even take that to wreak havoc. Here are their results, and the numbers are conservative for reasons mentioned below.<br /><br />\"Randomly stalling 20 percent of cars during rush hour would mean total traffic freeze. At 20 percent, the city has been broken up into small islands, where you may be able to inch around a few blocks, but no one would be able to move across town,\" said David Yanni, a graduate research assistant in Junker's lab.<br /><br />Not all cars on the road would have to be connected, just enough for hackers to stall 20 percent of all cars on the road. For example, if 40 percent of all cars on the road were connected, hacking half would suffice.<br /><br />Hacking 10 percent of all cars at rush hour would debilitate traffic enough to prevent emergency vehicles from expediently cutting through traffic that is inching along citywide. The same thing would happen with a 20 percent hack during intermediate daytime traffic.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />The researchers' results appear in the journal Physical Review E on July 20, 2019.<br /><br />It could take less<br /><br />For the city to be safe, hacking damage would have to be below that. In other cities, things could be worse.<br /><br />\"Manhattan has a nice grid, and that makes traffic more efficient. Looking at cities without large grids like Atlanta, Boston, or Los Angeles, and we think hackers could do worse harm because a grid makes you more robust with redundancies to get to the same places down many different routes,\" Yunker said.<br /><br />The researchers left out factors that would likely worsen hacking damage, thus a real-world hack may require stalling even fewer cars to shut down Manhattan.<br /><br />\"I want to emphasize that we only considered static situations -- if roads are blocked or not blocked. In many cases, blocked roads spill over traffic into other roads, which we also did not include. If we were to factor in these other things, the number of cars you'd have to stall would likely drop down significantly,\" Yunker said.<br /><br />The researchers also did not factor in ensuing public panic nor car occupants becoming pedestrians that would further block streets or cause accidents. Nor did they consider hacks that would target cars at locations that maximize trouble.<br /><br />They also stress that they are not cybersecurity experts, nor are they saying anything about the likelihood of someone carrying out such a hack. They simply want to give security experts a calculable idea of the scale of a hack that would shut a city down.<br /><br />The researchers do have some general ideas of how to reduce the potential damage.<br /><br />\"Split up the digital network influencing the cars to make it impossible to access too many cars through one network,\" said lead author Skanka Vivek, a postdoctoral researcher in Yunker's lab. \"If you could also make sure that cars next to each other can't be hacked at the same time that would decrease the risk of them blocking off traffic together.\"<br /><br />Traffic jams as physics<br /><br />Yunker researches in soft matter physics, which looks at how constituent parts -- in this case, connected cars -- act as one whole physical phenomenon.

The issue has also been fixed in the latest release of the software. While no attack from this vulnerability is known, the National Institutes of Standards and Technology recently described it in a note to software developers, genomics researchers and network administrators.<br /><br />The discovery reveals that protecting genomic information involves more than safe storage of an individual's genetic information. The cybersecurity of computer systems analyzing genetic data is also crucial, said Corey Hudson, a bioinformatics researcher at Sandia who helped uncover the issue.<br /><br />Personalized medicine -- the process of using a patient's genetic information to guide medical treatment -- involves two steps: sequencing the entire genetic content from a patient's cells and comparing that sequence to a standardized human genome. Through that comparison, doctors identify specific genetic changes in a patient that are linked to disease.<br /><br />Genome sequencing starts with cutting and replicating a person's genetic information into millions of small pieces. Then a machine reads each piece numerous times and transforms images of the pieces into sequences of building blocks, commonly represented by the letters A, T, C and G. Finally, software collects those sequences and matches each snippet to its place on a standardized human genome sequence. One matching program used widely by personalized genomics researchers is called Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA).<br /><br />Sandia researchers studying the cybersecurity of this program found a weak spot when the program imports the standardized genome from government servers. The standardized genome sequence traveled over insecure channels, which created the opportunity for a common cyberattack called a \"man-in-the-middle.\"<br /><br />In this attack, an adversary or a hacker could intercept the standard genome sequence and then transmit it to a BWA user along with a malicious program that alters genetic information obtained from sequencing. The malware could then change a patient's raw genetic data during genome mapping, making the final analysis incorrect without anyone knowing it. Practically, this means doctors may prescribe a drug based on the genetic analysis that, had they had the correct information, they would have known would be ineffective or toxic to a patient.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />Forensic labs and genome sequencing companies that also use this mapping software were also temporarily vulnerable to having results maliciously altered in the same way. Information from direct-to-consumer genetic tests was not affected by this vulnerability because these tests use a different sequencing method than whole genome sequencing, Hudson said.<br /><br />Security cybersleuths<br /><br />To find this vulnerability, Hudson and his cybersecurity colleagues at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign used a platform developed by Sandia called Emulytics to simulate the process of genome mapping. First, they imported genetic information simulated to resemble that from a sequencer. Then they had two servers send information to Emulytics. One provided a standard genome sequence and the other acted as the \"man-in-the-middle\" interceptor. The researchers mapped the sequencing results and compared results with and without an attack to see how the attack changed the final sequence.<br /><br />\"Once we discovered that this attack could change a patient's genetic information, we followed responsible disclosure,\" Hudson said. The researchers contacted the open source developers, who then issued a patch to fix the problem. They also contacted public agencies, including cybersecurity experts at the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team, so they could more widely distribute information about this issue.<br /><br />The research, funded by Sandia's Laboratory Directed Research and Development program, continues testing other genome mapping software for security weaknesses. Differences between each program mean the researchers might find a similar, but not identical, issue in other programs, Hudson said.<br /><br />Along with installing the latest version of BWA, Hudson and his colleagues recommend other \"cyberhygiene\" strategies to secure genomic information, including transmitting data over encrypted channels and using software that protects sequencing data from being changed. They also encourage security researchers who routinely analyze open source software for weaknesses to look at genomics programs. This practice is common in industrial control systems in the energy grid and software used in critical infrastructure, Hudson said, but would be a new area for genomics security.<br /><br />\"Our goal is to make systems safer for people who use them by helping to develop best practices,\" he said.<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

Most of the vulnerabilities were found in password managers used by millions of people to store their login credentials. Several other applications were found to be similarly susceptible to attacks and breaches across the Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />Computer software often starts multiple processes to perform different tasks. For example, a password manager typically has two parts: a password vault and an extension to an internet browser, which both run as separate processes on the same computer.<br /><br />To exchange data, these processes use a mechanism called inter-process communication (IPC), which remains within the confines of the computer and does not send information to an outside network. For this reason, IPC has traditionally been considered secure. However, the software needs to protect its internal communication from other processes running on the same computer. Otherwise, malicious processes started by other users could access the data in the IPC communication channel.<br /><br />'Many security-critical applications, including several password managers, do not properly protect the IPC channel. This means that other users' processes running on a shared computer may access the communication channel and potentially steal users' credentials,' explains Thanh Bui, a doctoral candidate at Aalto University.<br /><br />While PCs are often thought to be personal, it is not uncommon that several people have access to the same machine. Large companies typically have a centralized identity and access management system that allows employees to log into any company computer. In these scenarios, it is possible for anyone in the company to launch attacks. An attacker can also log in to the computer as a guest or connect remotely, if these features are enabled.<br /><br />'The number of vulnerable applications shows that software developers often overlook the security problems related to inter-process communication.

Questions regarding privacy, ownership, cybersecurity and public safety arise, as heavily guarded mapping data is collected and leveraged by companies. The geospatial data can be used to draw new maps identifying the spaces where we live and travel. That information is currently housed in technological and corporate black boxes. Given the social relevance and impacts of such information, these black boxes require greater transparency, according to a Dartmouth study posted in Cartographic Perspectives.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />As autonomous cars strive to make sense of the world around them, they collect massive amounts of data, including traffic and congestion patterns, where pedestrians cross the street, which houses and businesses have Wi-Fi, and other details, which could be monetized. While companies may have intellectual property and other economic interests in protecting geospatial data, local governments, private citizens and other actors also have a vested interest in using that data to inform decisions on managing traffic, urban planning, allocating public funds and other projects, all of which may be of public interest.<br /><br />\"Self-driving cars have the potential to transform our transportation network and society at large. This carries enormous consequences given that the data and technology are likely to fundamentally reshape the way our cities and communities operate,\" explains study author, Luis F. Alvarez Le&oacute;n, an assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth.<br /><br />\"Right now, the geospatial data obtained by a self-driving car exists in technological and corporate black boxes. We don't know who can see the data, appropriate it or profit from it. With insufficient government regulation of data from self-driving cars, this raises significant concerns regarding privacy, security and public safety,\" Alvarez Le&oacute;n adds.<br /><br />The author discusses how legislation, open source design and hacking are avenues that can be leveraged to help open the black box, enabling consumers and the government to gain access to this corporate collected information. While each of these three approaches has potential risks and rewards, they can help frame the public debate on the ownership and use of geospatial data from self-driving cars.    Autonomous cars rely on computerized systems to run. User access to this data proves difficult when they are locked in closed networks controlled by automobile manufacturers. The study looks at how legislation could help make this data more accessible. Car manufacturers typically consider themselves the sole arbiters of the information pertaining to their vehicles, claiming that they \"own the data\" but legislation has provided pushback and the author cites examples, such as debates around the right to repair.    When autonomous cars, including their components, assembly, operation and data, are designed through an open source framework, data might be more easily available to the public and inform greater understanding about its potential uses and implications, the author suggests.    Companies such as Udacity, an online education company, offers a Self-driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program in which students learn, develop and refine code for autonomous systems. Although there may be economic and intellectual property tradeoffs for the manufacturers, open source design plays an important role in allowing for greater transparency, according to the study.        In addition to legislation and open source design, hacking is both a systemic risk for autonomous vehicles and an approach that has been deployed to make car data and automated systems more transparent while holding self-driving car companies more accountable. In 2013 and 2015, two security experts remotely hacked into a 2014 Jeep Cherokee, and a Toyota Prius and Ford Escape, respectively, demonstrating the security flaws in vehicles that were not autonomous. Security vulnerabilities are likely to run much deeper with fully autonomous vehicles.Precisely because hacking is a generalized risk for autonomous vehicles, certain instances of hacking in the context of research and advocacy have shown the importance of building secure systems. Recent security breaches with Equifax and Facebook illustrate the many security risks relating to consumers' digital information. \"If we're going to adopt self-driving cars, then we should really make absolutely sure that they are as secure as they can be. This requires input from parties outside of the corporations who are building those very systems, such as government, advocacy groups and civil society at large.\" says Alvarez Le&oacute;n.<br /><br />In the U.S., Arizona, California and Michigan are currently some of the most hospitable states for self-driving vehicles, serving as testing areas for companies such as Waymo, which started as Google's Self-Driving Car Project. While there are local regulatory battles, and often pushback from citizens and advocacy groups, other states may open their doors to this new mode of transportation in the future. Two weeks ago, Waymo announced that it will be building a manufacturing facility in southeast Michigan, as it looks to grow its fleet. As the study points out, oversight of the self-driving car industry cannot be left to the manufacturers themselves. It is up to the public and government to help define how this new technology and subsequent mapping of our communities will affect our society.<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

Security vulnerabilities are likely to run much deeper with fully autonomous vehicles.Precisely because hacking is a generalized risk for autonomous vehicles, certain instances of hacking in the context of research and advocacy have shown the importance of building secure systems. Recent security breaches with Equifax and Facebook illustrate the many security risks relating to consumers' digital information. \"If we're going to adopt self-driving cars, then we should really make absolutely sure that they are as secure as they can be. This requires input from parties outside of the corporations who are building those very systems, such as government, advocacy groups and civil society at large.\" says Alvarez Le&oacute;n.<br /><br />In the U.S., Arizona, California and Michigan are currently some of the most hospitable states for self-driving vehicles, serving as testing areas for companies such as Waymo, which started as Google's Self-Driving Car Project. While there are local regulatory battles, and often pushback from citizens and advocacy groups, other states may open their doors to this new mode of transportation in the future. Two weeks ago, Waymo announced that it will be building a manufacturing facility in southeast Michigan, as it looks to grow its fleet. As the study points out, oversight of the self-driving car industry cannot be left to the manufacturers themselves. It is up to the public and government to help define how this new technology and subsequent mapping of our communities will affect our society.<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

Processors for industrial production of less than 10 nm in dimension are highly sensitive.

To defend such attacks on industrial facilities in the future, researchers of KIT are now working on a smart self-monitoring system.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />The new approach is based on identifying thermal patterns during normal operation of processors. \"Every chip produces a specific thermal fingerprint,\" explains Professor J&ouml;rg Henkel, who heads the team at the Chair for Embedded Systems (CES). \"Calculations are carried out, something is stored in the main memory or retrieved from the hard disk. All these operations produce short-term heating and cooling in various areas of the processor.\" Henkel's team monitored this pattern with sensitive infrared cameras and reproduced changes in the control routine from minimum temperature changes or temporal deviations of a few milliseconds. The setup with infrared cameras was used to demonstrate feasibility of such thermal monitoring. In the future, sensors on the chip are planned to assume the function of the cameras. \"We already have temperature sensors on chips. They are used for overheat protection,\" J&ouml;rg Henkel says. \"We will increase the number of sensors and use them for cyber security purposes for the first time.\" In addition, the scientists want to equip the chips with neural networks to identify thermal deviations and to monitor the chip in real time.<br /><br />The researchers think that their smart heat control will be applied in industrial facilities first. As mostly static control routines are executed, deviations are easier to identify than in a smartphone, for instance. However, also industry computers are exposed to dynamic threats. \"As soon as the hackers will know that we monitor temperature, they will adapt,\" computer scientist Hussam Amrouch, who works in the team of J&ouml;rg Henkel, explains. \"They will write smaller or slower programs, whose heating profiles will be more difficult to identify.\" Right from the start, the neural networks will therefore be trained to identify even modified threats.<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

These techniques could be used by hackers to learn which websites users have visited as they surf the web.<br /><br />Share:FULL STORYSecurity researchers at UC San Diego and Stanford have discovered four new ways to expose Internet users' browsing histories. These techniques could be used by hackers to learn which websites users have visited as they surf the web.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />The techniques fall into the category of \"history sniffing\" attacks, a concept dating back to the early 2000s. But the attacks demonstrated by the researchers at the 2018 USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT) in Baltimore can profile or 'fingerprint' a user's online activity in a matter of seconds, and work across recent versions of major web browsers.<br /><br />All of the attacks the researchers developed in their WOOT 2018 paper worked on Google Chrome. Two of the attacks also worked on a range of other browsers, from Mozilla Firefox to Microsoft Edge, as well various security-focused research browsers. The only browser which proved immune to all of the attacks is the Tor Browser, which doesn't keep a record of browsing history in the first place.<br /><br />\"My hope is that the severity of some of our published attacks will push browser vendors to revisit how they handle history data, and I'm happy to see folks from Mozilla, Google, and the broader World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) community already engage in this,\" said Deian Stefan, an assistant professor in computer science at the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego and the paper's senior author.<br /><br />\"History sniffing\": smelling out your trail across the web<br /><br />Most Internet users are by now familiar with \"phishing;\" cyber-criminals build fake websites which mimic, say, banks, to trick them into entering their login details. The more the phisher can learn about their potential victim, the more likely the con is to succeed. For example, a Chase customer is much more likely to be fooled when presented with a fake Chase login page than if the phisher pretends to be Bank of America.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />After conducting an effective history sniffing attack, a criminal could carry out a smart phishing scheme, which automatically matches each victim to a faked page corresponding to their actual bank. The phisher preloads the attack code with their list of target banking websites, and conceals it in, for example, an ordinary-looking advertisement. When a victim navigates to a page containing the attack, the code runs through this list, testing or 'sniffing' the victim's browser for signs that it's been used to visit each target site. When one of these sites tests positive, the phisher could then redirect their victim to the corresponding faked version.<br /><br />The faster the attack, the longer the list of target sites an attacker can 'sniff' in a reasonable amount of time. The fastest history sniffing attacks have reached rates of thousands of URLs tested per second, allowing attackers to quickly put together detailed profiles of web surfers' online activity. Criminals could put this sensitive data to work in a number of ways besides phishing: for example, by blackmailing users with embarrassing or compromising details of their browsing histories.<br /><br />History sniffing can also be deployed by legitimate, yet unscrupulous, companies, for purposes like marketing and advertising. A 2010 study from UC San Diego documented widespread commercial abuse of previously known history sniffing attack techniques, before these were subsequently fixed by browser vendors.<br /><br />\"You had internet marketing firms popping up, hawking pre-packaged, commercial history sniffing 'solutions', positioned as analytics tools,\" said Michael Smith, a computer science Ph.D. student at UC San Diego and the paper's lead author. The tools purported to offer insights into the activity of their clients' customers on competitors' websites, as well as detailed profiling information for ad targeting -- but at the expense of those customers' privacy.<br /><br />\"Though we don't believe this is happening now, similar spying tools could be built today by abusing the flaws we discovered,\" said Smith.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />New attacks<br /><br />The attacks the researchers developed, in the form of JavaScript code, cause web browsers to behave differently based on whether a website had been visited or not. The code can observe these differences -- for example, the time an operation takes to execute or the way a certain graphic element is handled -- to collect the computer's browsing history. To design the attacks, researchers exploited features that allow programmers to customize the appearance of their web page -- controlling fonts, colors, backgrounds, and so forth -- using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), as well as a cache meant to improve to performance of web code.<br /><br />The researchers' four attacks target flaws in relatively new browser features. For example, one attack takes advantage of a feature added to Chrome in 2017, dubbed the \"CSS Paint API,\" which lets web pages provide custom code for drawing parts of their visual appearance. Using this feature, the attack measures when Chrome re-renders a picture linked to a particular target website URL, in a way invisible to the user. When a re-render is detected, it indicates that the user has previously visited the target URL. \"This attack would let an attacker check around 6,000 URLs a second and develop a profile of a user's browsing habits at an alarming rate,\" said Fraser Brown, a Ph.D. student at Stanford, who worked closely with Smith.<br /><br />Though Google immediately patched this flaw -- the most egregious of the attacks that the researchers developed -- the computer scientists describe three other attacks in their WOOT 2018 paper that, put together, work not only on Chrome but Firefox, Edge, Internet Explorer, but on Brave as well. The Tor Browser is the only browser known to be totally immune to all the attacks, as it intentionally avoids storing any information about a user's browsing history.<br /><br />As new browsers add new features, these kinds of attacks on privacy are bound to resurface.<br /><br />A proposed defense<br /><br />The researchers propose a bold fix to these issues: they believe browsers should set explicit boundaries controlling how users' browsing histories are used to display web pages from different sites. One major source of information leakage was the mechanism which colors links either blue or purple depending on whether the user has visited their destination pages, so that, for example, someone clicking down a Google search results page can keep their place. Under the researchers' model, clicking links on one website (e.g., Google) wouldn't affect the color of links appearing on another website (e.g., Facebook). Users could potentially grant exceptions to certain websites of their choosing. The researchers are prototyping this fix and evaluating the trade-offs of such a privacy-conscious browser.<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

As part of their ongoing research into detecting vulnerabilities of devices and networks expanding in the smart home and Internet of Things (IoT), the researchers disassembled and reverse engineered many common devices and quickly uncovered serious security issues.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />\"It is truly frightening how easily a criminal, voyeur or pedophile can take over these devices,\" says Dr. Yossi Oren, a senior lecturer in BGU's Department of Software and Information Systems Engineering and head of the Implementation Security and Side-Channel Attacks Lab at Cyber@BGU. \"Using these devices in our lab, we were able to play loud music through a baby monitor, turn off a thermostat and turn on a camera remotely, much to the concern of our researchers who themselves use these products.\"<br /><br />\"It only took 30 minutes to find passwords for most of the devices and some of them were found only through a Google search of the brand,\" says Omer Shwartz, a Ph.D. student and member of Dr. Oren's lab. \"Once hackers can access an IoT device, like a camera, they can create an entire network of these camera models controlled remotely.\"<br /><br />The BGU researchers discovered several ways hackers can take advantage of poorly secured devices. They discovered that similar products under different brands share the same common default passwords. Consumers and businesses rarely change device passwords when purchased so they could be operating infected with malicious code for years.<br /><br />They were also able to logon to entire Wi-Fi networks simply be retrieving the password stored in a device to gain network access.<br /><br />Dr. Oren urges manufacturers to stop using easy, hard-coded passwords, to disable remote access capabilities, and to make it harder to get information from shared ports, like an audio jack which was proven vulnerable in other studies by Cyber@BGU researchers. \"It seems getting IoT products to market at an attractive price is often more important than securing them properly,\" he says.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />Tips for IoT Product Security<br /><br />With the goal of making consumers smarter about smart home device protection, BGU researchers offer a number of tips to keep IoT devices, families and businesses more secure:1. Buy IoT devices only from reputable manufacturers and vendors.    2. Avoid used IoT devices. They could already have malware installed.    3. Research each device online to determine if it has a default password and if so change before installing.    4. Use strong passwords with a minimum of 16 letters. These are hard to crack.    5. Multiple devices shouldn't share the same passwords.    6. Update software regularly which you will only get from reputable manufacturers.    7. Carefully consider the benefits and risks of connecting a device to the internet.\"The increase in IoT technology popularity holds many benefits, but this surge of new, innovative and cheap devices reveals complex security and privacy challenges,\" says Yael Mathov, who also participated in the research. \"We hope our findings will hold manufacturers more accountable and help alert both manufacturers and consumers to the dangers inherent in the widespread use of unsecured IoT devices.\"<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

Firms were more likely to fix issues related to spam emails originating from their compromised computers, but failed to act when they were found to host phishing websites on their servers. Most of the firms with phishing websites are actually hosting service providers.<br /><br />The researchers conducted a randomized field experiment on organizations in Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Macau, Malaysia and Taiwan -- which were chosen for their significant economic development as well as rapid adoption of technologies. The experiment evaluated each organization's preparedness against two distinct security issues: spam emissions and phishing website hosting. Spam usually consists of unsolicited bulk messages sent out by compromised \"zombie\" computers controlled by cyber attackers, while phishing refers to fraudulently obtaining sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card details for malicious reasons.<br /><br />\"For companies hosting phishing websites, there were fewer incentives to crack down on the sites since they were operated by paying customers and the sites failed to negatively impact the company itself,\" explains Gene Moo Lee, study co-author and assistant professor of Accounting and Information Systems at the UBC Sauder School of Business.<br /><br />The researchers developed and assigned an information security score, similar to the idea of Moody's and Standard and Poor's credit ratings, to each organization. The score can be used as an indicator of each organization's security vulnerabilities.<br /><br />The security results from each company were then published online. According to Lee, publicizing firms' security levels not only leads to greater transparency, but it could also be used to strengthen their security over time. In addition, organizations with poor performance could face greater pressure from their customers and a loss of reputation.<br /><br />\"The ever-increasing number of cyberattacks motivated my co-authors and I to explore a more effective way to enhance the security awareness of organizations and the general public,\" explains Lee. \"By establishing a ranking scheme of firms against online scams, we hope this will heighten firms' awareness to address suboptimal security issues.\"<br /><br />For Lee, cybersecurity is an international concern that needs to be managed more effectively. \"Many organizations don't understand the threats posed by emerging, sophisticated cyberattacks and usually adopt a wait-and-see approach in security investments until a huge security incident affects them significantly,\" he said. \"Our hope with this research is that companies improve their security levels to prevent the potential of cyberattacks from happening in the first place. And, ultimately, the goal of our research is to provide insights for cybersecurity policy makers.\"<br /><br />\"Information Disclosure and Security Policy Design: A Large-Scale Randomization Experiment in Pan-Asia\" was recently presented at the Workshop on Economics of Information Security.

Firms were more likely to fix issues related to spam emails originating from their compromised computers, but failed to act when they were found to host phishing websites on their servers. Most of the firms with phishing websites are actually hosting service providers.<br /><br />The researchers conducted a randomized field experiment on organizations in Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Macau, Malaysia and Taiwan -- which were chosen for their significant economic development as well as rapid adoption of technologies. The experiment evaluated each organization's preparedness against two distinct security issues: spam emissions and phishing website hosting. Spam usually consists of unsolicited bulk messages sent out by compromised \"zombie\" computers controlled by cyber attackers, while phishing refers to fraudulently obtaining sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card details for malicious reasons.<br /><br />\"For companies hosting phishing websites, there were fewer incentives to crack down on the sites since they were operated by paying customers and the sites failed to negatively impact the company itself,\" explains Gene Moo Lee, study co-author and assistant professor of Accounting and Information Systems at the UBC Sauder School of Business.<br /><br />The researchers developed and assigned an information security score, similar to the idea of Moody's and Standard and Poor's credit ratings, to each organization. The score can be used as an indicator of each organization's security vulnerabilities.<br /><br />The security results from each company were then published online. According to Lee, publicizing firms' security levels not only leads to greater transparency, but it could also be used to strengthen their security over time. In addition, organizations with poor performance could face greater pressure from their customers and a loss of reputation.<br /><br />\"The ever-increasing number of cyberattacks motivated my co-authors and I to explore a more effective way to enhance the security awareness of organizations and the general public,\" explains Lee. \"By establishing a ranking scheme of firms against online scams, we hope this will heighten firms' awareness to address suboptimal security issues.\"<br /><br />For Lee, cybersecurity is an international concern that needs to be managed more effectively. \"Many organizations don't understand the threats posed by emerging, sophisticated cyberattacks and usually adopt a wait-and-see approach in security investments until a huge security incident affects them significantly,\" he said. \"Our hope with this research is that companies improve their security levels to prevent the potential of cyberattacks from happening in the first place.

The researchers assessed responses from 50,000 teens from around the world to determine predictors of hacking and are the first to dig into gendered differences from a global data set.<br /><br />Share:FULL STORYIs your kid obsessed with video games and hanging out with questionable friends? These are common traits for involvement in cybercrime, among other delinquencies. New research from Michigan State University identified characteristics and gender-specific behaviors in kids that could lead them to become juvenile hackers.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />\"We know much about the scope of hacking and its threat, but the problem is that we don't know exactly when and how hacking behavior starts,\" said Thomas Holt, lead author and MSU cybercrime expert in the School of Criminal Justice. \"There is a general understanding that hacking starts in the early teens but until now, we weren't clear on background factors, such as behavioral issues, the impact of social connections or personality traits. Our findings pointed us in the direction of thinking that there are gendered pathways to hacking.\"<br /><br />Holt assessed responses from 50,000 teens from around the world to determine predictors of hacking. The findings, published in Crime &amp; Delinquency, are the first to dig into gendered differences from a global data set.<br /><br />\"We found that predictors of juvenile delinquency, like low self-control -- so, not having the ability to hold back when opportunity presents itself -- are big factors for computer hacking for both boys and girls,\" Holt said. \"But for girls, peer associations mattered more. If she has friends who shoplift or engage in petty forms of crime, she's more likely to be influenced to hack as well. For boys, we found that time spent watching TV or playing computer games were associated with hacking.\"<br /><br />Holt explained that the stark differences between boys and girls were quite distinct, reinforcing the idea that girls get into hacking in ways that greatly differed from boys. He said that some of the findings play to how kids are raised within gender roles, such as letting boys play video games and giving girls different activities.<br /><br />For boys and girls, simply having opportunities to hack were significant in starting such behavior.<br /><br />This could include having their own bedroom, their own computer or the freedom of doing what they want on the internet without parental supervision.<br /><br />While most schools have computer and internet access, Holt explained that there are still some geographic barriers for kids to enter cybercrime. The researchers found that kids who had mobile phone access early on were more likely to hack -- especially if they lived in larger cities. Spending time with peers was more likely to influence delinquent behavior for those living in smaller cities. The researchers also found a connection between pirating movies and music and hacking.<br /><br />In the 1980s and 1990s, juvenile hacking was mostly limited to gaming purposes, and even now most initial cybercrime isn't serious, such as getting into Facebook or email accounts, Holt said.<br /><br />\"The initial attempts might not be serious, but without supervision and low self-control, it's likely they got a taste for what they might be able to accomplish by taking their hacking abilities further,\" Holt said. \"And while low self-control plays a huge role with kids and teens, some of them mature as they age and can sit for hours, which gives them time to refine the skills of a sophisticated hacker.\"<br /><br />It's important for parents to understand their kids' tech-savviness and habits to help guide them on a path that uses their skills in a more positive way.<br /><br />\"Parents shouldn't assume that having a kid with sophisticated technological competency is always totally fine,\" Holt said. \"Finding others in the field -- like those you'd meet in a robotics club or attending something like the DefCon conference -- is vital for kids to learn about using their skills in a positive way and for staving off bad behaviors,\" Holt said. \"Cybercrime can be a hidden problem, so talking is vital. The more you can understand what they're doing, the easier you can flag something that might be off and curtail activity.\"<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

This \"zero-overhead\" method uses the same PUF components to make both keys and does not require extra area and latency because of an innovative design feature that also allows their PUF to be about 15 times more energy efficient than previously published versions.<br /><br />\"Basically each PUF unit can work in two modes,\" said Yang, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering. \"In the first mode, it creates one fingerprint, and in the other mode it gives a second fingerprint. Each one is a unique identifier, and dual keys are much better for reliability. On the off chance the device fails in the first mode, it can use the second key. The probability that it will fail in both modes is extremely small.\"<br /><br />As a means of authentication, PUF fingerprints have several of the same advantages as human fingerprints, he said.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />\"First, they are unique,\" Yang said. \"You don't have to worry about two people having the same fingerprint. Second, they are bonded to the individual. You cannot change your fingerprint or copy it to someone else's finger. And finally, a fingerprint is unclonable. There's no way to create a new person who has the same fingerprint as someone else.\"<br /><br />PUF-derived encryption keys are also unique, bonded and unclonable. To understand why, it helps to understand that each transistor on a computer chip is incredibly small. More than a billion of them can be crammed onto a chip half the size of a credit card. But for all their precision, microchips are not perfect. The difference between transistors can amount to a few more atoms in one or a few less in another, but those miniscule differences are enough to produce the electronic fingerprints used to make PUF keys.<br /><br />For a 128-bit key, a PUF device would send request signals to an array of PUF cells comprising several hundred transistors, allocating a one or zero to each bit based on the responses from the PUF cells. Unlike a numeric key that's stored in a traditional digital format, PUF keys are actively created each time they're requested, and different keys can be used by activating a different set of transistors.<br /><br />Adopting PUF would allow chipmakers to inexpensively and securely generate secret keys for encryption as a standard feature on next-generation computer chips for IoT devices like \"smart home\" thermostats, security cameras and lightbulbs.<br /><br />Encrypted lightbulbs? If that sounds like overkill, consider that unsecured IoT devices are what three young computer savants assembled by the hundreds of thousands to mount the October 2016 distributed denial-of-service attack that crippled the internet on the East Coast for most of a day.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />\"The general concept for IoT is to connect physical objects to the internet in order to integrate the physical and cyber worlds,\" Yang said. \"In most consumer IoT today, the concept isn't fully realized because many of the devices are powered and almost all use existing IC feature sets that were developed for the mobile market.\"<br /><br />In contrast, the devices coming out of research labs like Yang's are designed for IoT from the ground up. Measuring just a few millimeters in size, the latest IoT prototypes can pack a processor, flash memory, wireless transmitter, antenna, one or more sensors, batteries and more into an area the size of a grain of rice.<br /><br />PUF is not a new idea for IoT security, but Yang and Li's version of PUF is unique in terms of reliability, energy efficiency and the amount of area it would take to implement on a chip. For starters, Yang said the performance gains were measured in tests at military-grade temperatures ranging from 125 degrees Celsius to minus 55 degrees Celsius and when supply voltage dropped by up to 50 percent.<br /><br />\"If even one transistor behaves abnormally under varying environmental conditions, the device will produce the wrong key, and it will look like an inauthentic device,\" Yang said. \"For that reason, reliability, or stability, is the most important measure for PUF.\"<br /><br />Energy efficiency also is important for IoT, where devices can be expected to run for a decade on a single battery charge. In Yang and Li's PUF, keys are created using a static voltage rather than by actively powering up the transistor. It's counterintuitive that the static approach would be more energy efficient because it's the equivalent of leaving the lights on 24/7 rather than flicking the switch to get a quick glance of the room.<br /><br />\"Normally, people have sleep mode activated, and when they want to create a key, they activate the transistor, switch it once and then put it to sleep again,\" Yang said. \"In our design, the PUF module is always on, but it takes very little power, even less than a conventional system in sleep mode.\"<br /><br />On-chip area -- the amount of space and expense manufacturers would have to allocate to put the PUF device on a production chip -- is the third metric where they outperform previously reported work. Their design occupied 2.37 square micrometers to generate one bit on prototypes produced using 65-nanometer complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology.<br /><br />The research was funded by Rice University.<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

However, greater awareness of the issue is also needed among individuals and organizations.<br /><br />Share:FULL STORYTechnology companies could be doing much more to protect individuals and organisations from the threats posed by phishing, according to research by the University of Plymouth.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />However, users also need to make themselves more aware of the dangers to ensure potential scammers do not obtain access to personal or sensitive information.<br /><br />Academics from Plymouth's Centre for Security, Communications and Network (CSCAN) Research assessed the effectiveness of phishing filters employed by various email service providers.<br /><br />They sent two sets of messages to victim accounts, using email content obtained from archives of reported phishing attacks, with the first as plain text with links removed and the second having links retained and pointing to their original destination.<br /><br />They then examined which mailbox it reached within email accounts as well as whether they were explicitly labelled in any way to denote them as suspicious or malicious.<br /><br />In the significant majority of cases (75% without links and 64% with links) the potential phishing messages made it into inboxes and were not in any way labelled to highlight them as spam or suspicious. Moreover, only 6% of messages were explicitly labelled as malicious.<br /><br />Professor Steven Furnell, leader of CSCAN, worked on the study with MSc student Kieran Millet and Associate Professor of Cyber Security Dr Maria Papadaki.<br /><br />He said: \"The poor performance of most providers implies they either do not employ filtering based on language content, or that it is inadequate to protect users. Given users' tendency to perform poorly at identifying malicious messages this is a worrying outcome. The results suggest an opportunity to improve phishing detection in general, but the technology as it stands cannot be relied upon to provide anything other than a small contribution in this context.\"<br /><br />The number of phishing incidents has risen dramatically since they were first recorded in 2003. In fact, global software giant Kaspersky Lab reported that its anti-phishing system was triggered 482,465,211 times in 2018, almost double the number for 2017.<br /><br />It is also a significant problem for businesses, with 80% telling the Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2019 that they have encountered 'Fraudulent emails or being directed to fraudulent websites' -- placing this category well ahead of malware and ransomware.<br /><br />Phishing is designed to trick victims into divulging sensitive information, such as identity and financial-related data, and the threat can actually take several forms:    Bulk-phishing -- where the approach is not specially targeted or tailored toward the recipient;    Spear-phishing -- where the message is targeted at specific individuals or companies and tailored accordingly;    Clone-phishing -- where the scammers take a legitimate email containing an attachment or link, and replace it with a malicious version;    Whaling -- in these cases the phishing is specifically targeted towards high value or senior individuals.Professor Furnell, who has previously led various projects relating to user-facing security, added: \"Phishing has now been a problem for over a decade and a half. Unfortunately, just like malware, it's proven to be the cyber security equivalent of an unwanted genie that we can't put back in the bottle. Despite many efforts to educate users and provide safeguards, people are still falling victim. Our study shows the technology can identify things that we would ideally want users to be able to spot for themselves -- but while there is a net, it clearly has big holes.\"<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

A search of five marketplaces in the darknet for this research uncovered 2,943 mentions for \"SSL\" and 75 for \"TLS.\" In comparison, there were just 531 mentions for \"ransomware.\"<br /><br />\"One very interesting aspect of this research was seeing TLS certificates packaged with wrap-around services -- such as Web design services -- to give attackers immediate access to high levels of online credibility and trust,\" he said. \"It was surprising to discover how easy and inexpensive it is to acquire extended validation certificates, along with all the documentation needed to create very credible shell companies without any verification information.\"<br /><br />\"This study found clear evidence of the rampant sale of TLS certificates on the darknet,\" said Kevin Bocek, vice president of security and threat intelligence for Venafi. \"TLS certificates that act as trusted machine identities are clearly a key part of cybercriminal toolkits, just like bots, ransomware and spyware.

Moore and Dr. Frederica Nelson reaching out to researchers in Asia Pacific regions through the international collaborative program administrated by the U.S. Army International Technology Center-Pacific.<br /><br />Cyberattacks on computer systems are becoming more common. Any company with information on a computer system connected to the internet might become a victim from someone or some group who wants to steal or destroy the company's data for their own use, or for ransom.<br /><br />This is possible because of the way the Internet is set up, researchers said. In order to access content on a website, a computer needs to know where to ask for the information. Websites have an address, what is known as an internet protocol, or IP, address; however, these are not just used for websites. Every computer connected to the internet has an IP address.<br /><br />Cyber attackers have time to discover the IP addresses of the computers they think might have valuable information and attack them using code that is more commonly known as computer viruses or worms.<br /><br />If the computer or system being attacked has a security system, such as a firewall or anti-virus software, it might be able to recognize some code as being bad and prevent itself from being infected.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />What cyber attackers do is slightly modify their bad code so it is not recognized until the computer's security system is updated or patched.<br /><br />Essentially, the typical defensive response to these attacks is passive, the researchers said. The attackers have time to prepare, plan and execute their attacks, whereas the potential victims are left reacting only after an intruder breaks into a computer system.<br /><br />Recently, a new proactive type of defense is being considered to protect important information in computer systems. This approach is known as moving target defense, or MTD.<br /><br />\"The concept of MTD has been introduced with the aim of increasing the adversary's confusion or uncertainty by dynamically changing the attack surface, which consists of the reachable and exploitable vulnerabilities,\" Cho said. \"MTD can lead to making the adversary's intelligence gained from previous monitoring no longer useful and accordingly results in poor attack decisions.\"<br /><br />The basic idea as it applies to IP addresses on computer networks is this: Change the IP address of the computer frequently enough so the attacker loses sight of where his victim is; however, this can be expensive, so the approach taken by the researchers in the collaboration here uses something known as software-defined networking.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />This lets computers keep their real IP addresses fixed, but masks them from the rest of the internet with virtual IP addresses that are frequently changing.<br /><br />Moore added that as the adage suggests, it is harder to hit a moving target.<br /><br />\"MTD increases uncertainty and confuses the adversary, as time is no longer an advantage,\" Moore said. \"The adversary has to expend more resources, such as time and/or computational power, to discover vulnerabilities of a target system, but will experience more difficulty in exploiting any vulnerabilities found in the past since their location or accessibility is constantly changing.\"<br /><br />According to Professor Hyuk Lim at GIST in the Republic of Korea, this proactive defense approach provides defense services before attackers get into a target system.<br /><br />\"Taking actions proactively requires extra overhead to add another layer of defense strength,\" Kim said. \"Hence, deploying the proactive defense and security mechanisms is not for free, but brings a cost because the system needs to constantly change the attack surface such as IP addresses. This cost can be mitigated to some extent by leveraging the technology called 'Software-Defined Networking'. The SDN technology provides highly efficient programmatic and dynamic management of the network policy by removing the network control from individual devices in a network to a centralized controller. The network configuration can be defined by the SDN controller, enabling more reliable and responsive network operations under variable conditions.\"<br /><br />Nelson explained the reason why these SDN-based MTD techniques are critical to supporting the vision of the Army and warfighters.<br /><br />\"The key technology of SDN-based MTD techniques, under development by the research team, is highly relevant to support the warfighters' mission execution by proactively thwarting potential attacks, which can protect the defense system so that the warfighters can properly execute the mission in the presence of highly dynamic, hostile and innovative adversaries within contested tactical environments,\" Nelson said.<br /><br />The UC team in New Zealand led the effort of developing the MTD technology called the Flexible Random Virtual IP Multiplexing, namely FRVM.<br /><br />\"In FRVM, while the real IP address of a server-host remains unchanged but stays hidden, a virtual IP address of the server-host keeps being randomly and periodically changed where the IP mapping/remapping (i.e., called multiplexing/demultiplexing) is performed by an SDN controller,\" said Dilli P. Sharma, a doctoral student in Prof. DongSeong Kim's cybersecurity research group at UC, New Zealand. \"This effectively forces the adversary to play the equivalent of an honest shell game. However, instead of guessing among three shells (IP addresses) to find a pea (a running network service), the adversary must guess among 65,536 shells, given address space2^16. This MTD protocol is novel because it provides high flexibility to have multiple, random, time-variant IP addresses in a host, which implies the adversary will require more time to discover an IP address of the target host.\"<br /><br />In this research, the team formulated the architecture and communication protocols for the proposed IP (de)multiplexing-based MTD to be applied in SDN environments.<br /><br />The team also validated the effectiveness of the FRVM under various degrees of scanning attacks in terms of the attack success probability.<br /><br />The preliminary results evaluating the FRVM were presented at the 17th Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications, or TrustCom'18, held in New York in August.<br /><br />\"Our next step is to study the trade-off in the FRVM between the dual conflicting goals of system security and performance, as proactive defense may introduce adverse effects when running MTD techniques while achieving enhanced security,\" Kim said.<br /><br />DP Sharma, D-S Kim, S Yoon, H Lim, J-H Cho, TJ Moore, \"FRVM: Flexible random virtual ip multiplexing in software-defined networks,\" 2018 17th IEEE International Conference On Trust, Security And Privacy In Computing And Communications, New York City, July 31- August 3, 2018, p. 579-587.<br /><br />Sharma DP, Kim DS, Yoon S, Lim H, Cho JH, Moore TJ.

The research revealed nearly 1,800 occurrences of large data breaches in patient information over a seven years, with 33 hospitals experiencing more than one substantial breach.<br /><br />For this paper, Jiang and co-author Ge Bai, associate professor at the John's Hopkins Carey Business School, dove deeper to identify triggers of the PHI data breaches. They reviewed nearly 1,150 cases between October 2009 and December 2017 that affected more than 164 million patients.<br /><br />\"Every time a hospital has some sort of a data breach, they need to report it to the Department of Health and Human Services and classify what they believe is the cause,\" Jiang, the Plante Moran Faculty Fellow, said. \"These causes fell into six categories: theft, unauthorized access, hacking or an IT incident, loss, improper disposal or 'other.'\"<br /><br />After reviewing detailed reports, assessing notes and reclassifying cases with specific benchmarks, Jiang and Bai found that 53 percent were the result of internal factors in healthcare entities.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />\"One quarter of all the cases were caused by unauthorized access or disclosure -- more than twice the amount that were caused by external hackers,\" Jiang said. \"This could be an employee taking PHI home or forwarding to a personal account or device, accessing data without authorization, or even through email mistakes, like sending to the wrong recipients, copying instead of blind copying or sharing unencrypted content.\"<br /><br />While some of the errors seem to be common sense, Jiang said that the big mistakes can lead to even bigger accidents and that seemingly innocuous errors can compromise patients' personal data.<br /><br />\"Hospitals, doctors offices, insurance companies, small physician offices and even pharmacies are making these kinds of errors and putting patients at risk,\" Jiang said.<br /><br />Of the external breaches, theft accounted for 33 percent with hacking credited for just 12 percent.<br /><br />While some data breaches might result in minor consequences, such as obtaining the phone numbers of patients, others can have much more invasive effects. For example, when Anthem, Inc. suffered a data breach in 2015, 37.5 million records were compromised. Many of the victims were not notified immediately, so weren't aware of the situation until they went to file their taxes only to discover that a third-party fraudulently filed them with the data they obtained from Anthem.<br /><br />While tight software and hardware security can protect from theft and hackers, Jiang and Bai suggest health care providers adopt internal policies and procedures that can tighten processes and prevent internal parties from leaking PHI by following a set of simple protocols. The procedures to mitigate PHI breaches related to storage include transitioning from paper to digital medical records, safe storage, moving to non-mobile policies for patient-protected information and implementing encryption. Procedures related to PHI communication include mandatory verification of mailing recipients, following a \"copy vs. blind copy\" protocol (bcc vs cc) as well as encryption of content.<br /><br />\"Not putting on the whole armor opened health care entities to enemy's attacks,\" Bai said. \"The good news is that the armor is not hard to put on if simple protocols are followed.\"<br /><br />Next, Jiang and Bai plan to look even more closely at the kind of data that is hacked from external sources to learn what exactly digital thieves hope to steal from patient data.<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

This is called \"network segmenting\" and is the best way to protect medical infrastructure, said Bland, the computer science graduate student at the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego.<br /><br />Researchers also would like to raise awareness of a new standard that could replace HL7: the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource, or FHIR, would allow for encrypted communications inside hospital networks.<br /><br />Hospital IT staff need to be made aware of cybersecurity issues and trained to put in place defenses against potential attacks, researchers said. For example, IT personnel need to know how to configure networks and servers to support encryption.

Even single, targeted attacks can result in major damage; when cybercriminals control and manipulate several nodes in a network, the potential for destruction increases.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />UC Santa Barbara computer science professor Dmitri Strukov is working to address the latter. He and his team are looking to put an extra layer of security on the growing number of internet- and Bluetooth-enabled devices with technology that aims to prevent cloning, the practice by which nodes in a network are replicated and then used to launch attacks from within the network. A chip that deploys ionic memristor technology, it is an analog memory hardware solution to a digital problem.<br /><br />\"You can think of it as a black box,\" said Strukov, whose new paper, \"Hardware-intrinsic security primitives enabled by analogue state and nonlinear conductance variations in integrated memristors,\" appears on the cover of Nature Electronics. Due to its nature, the chip is physically unclonable and can thus render the device invulnerable to hijacking, counterfeiting or replication by cyber criminals.<br /><br />Key to this technology is the memristor, or memory resistor -- an electrical resistance switch that can \"remember\" its state of resistance based on its history of applied voltage and current. Not only can memristors can change their outputs in response to their histories, but each memristor, due to the physical structure of its material, also is unique in its response to applied voltage and current. Therefore, a circuit made of memristors results in a black box of sorts, as Strukov called it, with outputs extremely difficult to predict based on the inputs.<br /><br />\"The idea is that it's hard to predict, and because it's hard to predict, it's hard to reproduce,\" Strukov said. The multitude of possible inputs can result in at least as many outputs -- the more memristors, the more possibilities. Running each would take more time than an attacker may reasonably have to clone one device, let alone a network of them.<br /><br />The use of memristors in today's cybersecurity is especially significant in light of machine learning-enabled hacking, in which artificial intelligence technology is trained to \"learn\" and model inputs and outputs, then predict the next sequence based on its model. With machine learning, an attacker doesn't even need to know what exactly is occurring as the computer is trained on a series of inputs and outputs of a system.<br /><br />\"For instance, if you have 2 million outputs and the attacker sees 10,000 or 20,000 of these outputs, he can, based on that, train a model that can copy the system afterwards,\" said Hussein Nili, the paper's lead author. The memristive black box can circumvent this method of attack because it makes the relationship between inputs and outputs look random enough to the outside world even as the circuits' internal mechanisms are repeatable enough to be reliable.<br /><br />\"It has to look random, but it should also be deterministic,\" he said.<br /><br />In addition to the variability embedded in these memristor circuits, other features include high throughput, speed and economy of energy use, making them an ideal component in the tight energy budget of the Internet of Things. Then there is the fact that this is already a semi-practical technology which can be used to both secure device identity and encrypt information.<br /><br />\"If we scale it a little bit further, it's going to be hardware which could be, in many metrics, the state-of-the-art,\" Strukov said.<br /><br />As they continue to refine this technology, Strukov and his team are investigating whether there will be any drifts in the characteristics over time. They also are developing \"strong\" security paths that require larger memristive circuits and additional techniques (suitable for sensitive military equipment or highly classified information), and \"weak\" paths geared more toward consumer electronics and everyday gadgets -- situations in which it would likely not be worth an attacker's time to spend hours or days hacking into a device.<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

Even single, targeted attacks can result in major damage; when cybercriminals control and manipulate several nodes in a network, the potential for destruction increases.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />UC Santa Barbara computer science professor Dmitri Strukov is working to address the latter. He and his team are looking to put an extra layer of security on the growing number of internet- and Bluetooth-enabled devices with technology that aims to prevent cloning, the practice by which nodes in a network are replicated and then used to launch attacks from within the network. A chip that deploys ionic memristor technology, it is an analog memory hardware solution to a digital problem.<br /><br />\"You can think of it as a black box,\" said Strukov, whose new paper, \"Hardware-intrinsic security primitives enabled by analogue state and nonlinear conductance variations in integrated memristors,\" appears on the cover of Nature Electronics. Due to its nature, the chip is physically unclonable and can thus render the device invulnerable to hijacking, counterfeiting or replication by cyber criminals.<br /><br />Key to this technology is the memristor, or memory resistor -- an electrical resistance switch that can \"remember\" its state of resistance based on its history of applied voltage and current. Not only can memristors can change their outputs in response to their histories, but each memristor, due to the physical structure of its material, also is unique in its response to applied voltage and current. Therefore, a circuit made of memristors results in a black box of sorts, as Strukov called it, with outputs extremely difficult to predict based on the inputs.<br /><br />\"The idea is that it's hard to predict, and because it's hard to predict, it's hard to reproduce,\" Strukov said. The multitude of possible inputs can result in at least as many outputs -- the more memristors, the more possibilities. Running each would take more time than an attacker may reasonably have to clone one device, let alone a network of them.<br /><br />The use of memristors in today's cybersecurity is especially significant in light of machine learning-enabled hacking, in which artificial intelligence technology is trained to \"learn\" and model inputs and outputs, then predict the next sequence based on its model. With machine learning, an attacker doesn't even need to know what exactly is occurring as the computer is trained on a series of inputs and outputs of a system.<br /><br />\"For instance, if you have 2 million outputs and the attacker sees 10,000 or 20,000 of these outputs, he can, based on that, train a model that can copy the system afterwards,\" said Hussein Nili, the paper's lead author. The memristive black box can circumvent this method of attack because it makes the relationship between inputs and outputs look random enough to the outside world even as the circuits' internal mechanisms are repeatable enough to be reliable.<br /><br />\"It has to look random, but it should also be deterministic,\" he said.<br /><br />In addition to the variability embedded in these memristor circuits, other features include high throughput, speed and economy of energy use, making them an ideal component in the tight energy budget of the Internet of Things. Then there is the fact that this is already a semi-practical technology which can be used to both secure device identity and encrypt information.<br /><br />\"If we scale it a little bit further, it's going to be hardware which could be, in many metrics, the state-of-the-art,\" Strukov said.<br /><br />As they continue to refine this technology, Strukov and his team are investigating whether there will be any drifts in the characteristics over time. They also are developing \"strong\" security paths that require larger memristive circuits and additional techniques (suitable for sensitive military equipment or highly classified information), and \"weak\" paths geared more toward consumer electronics and everyday gadgets -- situations in which it would likely not be worth an attacker's time to spend hours or days hacking into a device.<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

He is part of a team developing models to efficiently operate a fleet, while maintaining security.<br /><br />Share:FULL STORYSearch and rescue crews are already using drones to locate missing hikers. Farmers are flying them over fields to survey crops. And delivery companies will soon use drones to drop packages at your doorstep.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />With so many applications for the technology, an Iowa State University researcher says the next step is to expand capacity by deploying fleets of drones. But making that happen is not as simple as launching multiple aircraft at once. Borzoo Bonakdarpour, an assistant professor of computer science, says unlike piloting a single drone by remote control, operating a fleet requires an automated system to coordinate the task, but allows drones to independently respond to weather, a crash or unexpected events.<br /><br />\"The operating system must be reliable and secure. The drones need to talk to one another without a central command telling each unit where to go and what to do when conditions change,\" Bonakdarpour said. \"We also want to optimize the time and energy to complete the task, because drone batteries only last around 15 or 20 minutes.\"<br /><br />To tackle this problem, Bonakdarpour and his colleagues developed a mathematical model to calculate the cost - time and energy - to complete a task based on the number of drones and recharging stations available. The model considers the energy required for each drone to complete its portion of the task and fly to a charging station as needed.<br /><br />On paper the solution is relatively simple for a team of computer scientists, but Bonakdarpour says moving from theory to implementation is not as easy. \"As we work on one problem, we actually find new problems we must solve. It's challenging, but that's also what makes it exciting,\" he said.<br /><br />For example, if a battery lasts 15 minutes in the lab, it may drop to 10 minutes on a hot or cold day outside. Locating charging stations is another issue. The optimal placement may be in the middle of a lake and inaccessible in reality.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />Managing tradeoff between energy and security<br /><br />Based on their model, Bonakdarpour, Anh-Duy Vu with McMaster University, Canada; and Ramy Medhat with Google in Waterloo, Canada, developed four operating methods - three offline optimization techniques and one online algorithm. While an offline technique is limited because the preprogrammed flight paths do not allow drones to respond to unexpected events or changing conditions, Bonakdarpour says it provides the foundation for the online algorithm to operate.<br /><br />The researchers conducted a series of simulations using four drones to test for efficiency and security. They found the online algorithm successfully managed the security-energy tradeoff within the energy limits of the drones. The fleet completed all assigned tasks and more than half of the authentication checks. The researchers recently presented the findings at the International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems in Canada.<br /><br />Defending against hackers, rogue drones<br /><br />Operating an automated fleet of drones poses security risks that are less of a concern when piloting a single drone by remote control. Bonakdarpour says with automation drones need to receive GPS signal and position frequently. If the signal drops or the drones fly into an area that is GPS-denied, it can quickly become a problem.<br /><br />\"If you're driving your car and lose GPS, your driving skills don't depend on that signal. You may miss an exit, but loss of signal for a minute is usually not a big deal. However, with drones just a few seconds is not tolerable,\" Bonakdarpour said.<br /><br />Software bugs or errors may cause a drone to fly off course and not follow direction to complete the mission. Bonakdarpour says hackers can also send the wrong signal or operate a drone to impersonate the fleet. While finding solutions will take time, Bonakdarpour says the technology exists to make it happen. However, it will also take industry support to build infrastructure and charging stations as well as regulatory changes to allow for the operation of a fleet of drones.<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

In a new paper, researchers examine how to use the commodity storage devices already in a computer to save the files without having to pay the ransom.<br /><br />Share:FULL STORYOne of the latest cyber threats involves hackers encrypting user files and then charging \"ransom\" to get them back. In the paper, \"Project Almanac: A Time-Traveling Solid State Drive,\" University of Illinois students Chance Coats and Xiaohao Wang and Assistant Professor Jian Huang from the Coordinated Science Laboratory look at how they can use the commodity storage devices already in a computer, to save the files without having to pay the ransom.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />\"The paper explains how we leverage properties of flash-based storage that currently exist in most laptops, desktops, mobiles, and even IoT devices\" said Coats, a graduate student in electrical and computer engineering (ECE). \"The motivation was a class of malware called ransomware, where hackers will take your files, encrypt them, delete the unencrypted files and then demand money to give the files back.\"<br /><br />The flash-based, solid-state drives Coats mentioned are part of the storage system in most computers. When a file is modified on the computer, rather than getting rid of the old file version immediately, the solid-state drive saves the updated version to a new location. Those old versions are the key to thwarting ransomware attacks. If there is an attack, the tool discussed in the paper can be used to revert to a previous version of the file. The tool would also help in the case of a user accidentally deleting one of their own files.<br /><br />Like any new tool, there is a trade-off.<br /><br />\"When you want to write new data, it has to be saved to a free block, or block that has already been erased,\" said Coats. \"Normally a solid-state drive would delete old versions in an effort to erase blocks in advance, but because our drive is keeping the old versions intentionally, it may have to move the old versions before writing new ones.\"<br /><br />Coats described this as a trade-off between retention duration and storage performance. If the parameters of their new tool are set to maintain data for too long, old and unnecessary versions will be kept and take up space on the storage device. As the device fills with old file versions, the system takes longer to respond to typical storage requests and performance degrades. On the other hand, if the parameters are set to a retention window that is too narrow, users would have a quicker response time, but they may not have all of their backup files saved should a malware attack take place.<br /><br />To manage this trade-off, Huang and his students built in functionality for the tool to monitor and adjust these parameters dynamically. Despite the dynamic changes to system parameters, their tool guarantees data will be retained for at least three days. This allows users the option to backup their data onto other systems within the guaranteed time-period if they choose to do so.<br /><br />The idea behind their tool has gained interest at an international level. The paper about this research was published at a top-tier system conference, EuroSys, this past spring. Coats represented the group at the conference.<br /><br />\"Our research group really enjoys building practical computer systems; this is a great practice for our students, they will experience how our research will generate real-world impact,\" said Huang, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Illinois. \"Moving forward, our group will look at the possibility of retaining user data in a storage device for a much longer time with lower performance overhead, and applying the time-traveling solid-state drive to wider applications such as systems debugging and digital forensics.\"<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

Instead, they arose from the architecture of the processors themselves -- that is, the millions of transistors that work together to execute operations.<br /><br />\"These attacks fundamentally changed our understanding of what's trustworthy in a system, and force us to re-examine where we devote security resources,\" says Ilia Lebedev, a PhD student at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). \"They've shown that we need to be paying much more attention to the microarchitecture of systems.\"<br /><br />Lebedev and his colleagues believe that they've made an important new breakthrough in this field, with an approach that makes it much harder for hackers to cash in on such vulnerabilities. Their method could have immediate applications in cloud computing, especially for fields like medicine and finance that currently limit their cloud-based features because of security concerns.<br /><br />With Meltdown and Spectre, hackers exploited the fact that operations all take slightly different amounts of time to execute. To use a simplified example, someone who's guessing a PIN might first try combinations \"1111\" through \"9111.\" If the first eight guesses take the same amount of time, and \"9111\" takes a nanosecond longer, then that one most likely has at least the \"9\" right, and the attacker can then start guessing \"9111\" through \"9911,\" and so on and so forth.<br /><br />An operation that's especially vulnerable to these so-called \"timing attacks\" is accessing memory. If systems always had to wait for memory before doing the next step of an action, they'd spend much of their time sitting idle.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />To keep performance up, engineers employ a trick: they give the processor the power to execute multiple instructions while it waits for memory -- and then, once memory is ready, discards the ones that weren't needed. This is called \"speculative execution.\"<br /><br />While it pays off in performance speed, it also creates new security issues. Specifically, the attacker could make the processor speculatively execute some code to read a part of memory it shouldn't be able to. Even if the code fails, it could still leak data that the attacker can then access.<br /><br />A common way to try to prevent such attacks is to split up memory so that it's not all stored in one area. Imagine an industrial kitchen shared by chefs who all want to keep their recipes secret. One approach would be to have the chefs set up their work on different sides -- that's essentially what happens with the \"Cache Allocation Technology\" (CAT) that Intel started using in 2016. But such a system is still quite insecure, since one chef can get a pretty good idea of others' recipes by seeing which pots and pans they take from the common area.<br /><br />In contrast, the MIT CSAIL team's approach is the equivalent of building walls to split the kitchen into separate spaces, and ensuring that everyone only knows their own ingredients and appliances. (This approach is a form of so-called \"secure way partitioning\"; the \"chefs,\" in the case of cache memory, are referred to as \"protection domains.\")<br /><br />As a playful counterpoint to Intel's CAT system, the researchers dubbed their method \"DAWG,\" which stands for \"Dynamically Allocated Way Guard.\" (The \"dynamic\" part means that DAWG can split the cache into multiple buckets whose size can vary over time.)<br /><br />Lebedev co-wrote a new paper about the project with lead author Vladimir Kiriansky and MIT professors Saman Amarasinghe, Srini Devadas and Joel Emer. They will present their findings next week at the annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO) in Fukuoka City, Japan.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />\"This paper dives into how to fully isolate one program's side-effects from percolating through to another program through the cache,\" says Mohit Tiwari, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved in the project. \"This work secures a channel that's one of the most popular to use for attacks.\"<br /><br />In tests, the team also found that the system was comparable with CAT on performance. They say that DAWG requires very minimal modifications to modern operating systems.<br /><br />\"We think this is an important step forward in giving computer architects, cloud providers and other IT professionals a better way to efficiently and dynamically allocate resources,\" says Kiriansky, a PhD student at CSAIL. \"It establishes clear boundaries for where sharing should and should not happen, so that programs with sensitive information can keep that data reasonably secure.\"<br /><br />The team is quick to caution that DAWG can't yet defend against all speculative attacks. However, they have experimentally demonstrated that it is a foolproof solution to a broad range of non-speculative attacks against cryptographic software.<br /><br />Lebedev says that the growing prevalence of these types of attacks demonstrates that, contrary to popular tech-CEO wisdom, more information-sharing isn't always a good thing.<br /><br />\"There's a tension between performance and security that's come to a head for a community of architecture designers that have always tried to share as much as possible in as many places as possible,\" he says. \"On the other hand, if security was the only priority, we'd have separate computers for every program we want to run so that no information could ever leak, which obviously isn't practical. DAWG is part of a growing body of work trying to reconcile these two opposing forces.\"<br /><br />It's worth recognizing that the sudden attention on timing attacks reflects the paradoxical fact that computer security has actually gotten a lot better in the last 20 years.<br /><br />\"A decade ago software wasn't written as well as it is today, which means that other attacks were a lot easier to perform,\" says Kiriansky. \"As other aspects of security have become harder to carry out, these microarchitectural attacks have become more appealing, though they're still fortunately just a small piece in an arsenal of actions that an attacker would have to take to actually do damage.\"<br /><br />The team is now working to improve DAWG so that it can stop all currently known speculative-execution attacks.

In the meantime, they're hopeful that companies such as Intel will be interested in adopting their idea -- or others like it -- to minimize the chance of future data breaches.<br /><br />\"These kinds of attacks have become a lot easier thanks to these vulnerabilities,\" says Kiriansky. \"With all the negative PR that's come up, companies like Intel have the incentives to get this right. The stars are aligned to make an approach like this happen.\"<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

Their attack, referred to as Efail, proved successful in 25 out of 35 tested email programs using the S/MIME encryption standard and in 10 out of 28 tested programs using OpenPGP. The program developers have been informed and have fixed the security gaps. The experts urgently recommend updating the underlying cryptographic algorithms in order to withstand any potential attacks in future.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />Realistic attack scenario<br /><br />Emails are encrypted in order to hide their contents from network providers, cybercriminals, and intelligence services who might gain access to them via hacked routers, an email server, or by recording a message during transmission. \"In the wake of Snowden's whistleblowing and countless hacked email servers, this is very much a realistic scenario,\" stresses Prof Dr Sebastian Schinzel from the Department Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at FH M&uuml;nster.<br /><br />The intercepted message is manipulated by the attacker as he adds his own malicious commands in encrypted form. Thus altered, the message is sent to one of the recipients or to the sender, i.e. where the data is stored that's necessary for deciphering it.<br /><br />After the message has been deciphered, the inserted commands cause the victim's email program to establish a communication connection with the attacker the next time the email is opened. This form of communication is pretty much standard when, for example, images or design elements in emails are loaded. Via that connection, the decoded email is then sent to the attacker who can read them. The researchers named this novel attack method \"Exfiltration with Malleability Gadgets.\"<br /><br />Enterprise, journalist, whistleblower<br /><br />The email encryption standards S/MIME -- short for Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions -- and OpenPGP have been in use since the 1990s. S/MIME is frequently deployed by enterprises that encrypt all outgoing and decrypt all incoming emails. OpenPGP is preferably used by individuals, for example, by journalists in conflict areas or by whistleblowers like Edward Snowden.<br /><br />The underlying cryptography hasn't been updated since the 1990s, even though better techniques have long been available. \"This type of cryptography has been broken more than once in other Internet standards, e.g. in TLS, short for Transport Layer Security, a protocol for the encryption of online data transmission. We have now demonstrated for the first time that it is also vulnerable as far as email encryption is concerned,\" explains Prof Dr J&ouml;rg Schwenk from the Chair for Network and Data Security at RUB.<br /><br />In its current version, S/MIME is not suitable for secure communication<br /><br />In the case of S/MIME, the successful attack has shown that the current standard is not suitable for secure communication. \"OpenPGP can be configured and used securely; however, this is often not the case as we showed in our practical analyses and should therefore be considered insecure,\" says J&ouml;rg Schwenk.<br /><br />Now, the Internet Engineering Task Force, a developer-independent international organisation, is called upon to provide a new standard, according to the researchers. Following their successful attack, the research team have informed the developers of all tested email programs of the security gap identified by them. Measures have been taken to close it, in order to minimise the risk of a successful genuine attack.<br /><br />Detailed information on their attack has been published on their website .<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

The flaws can be used to prevent security systems from signaling that there has been a break-in or uploading video of intruders.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />\"IoT devices are becoming increasingly common, and there's an expectation that they can contribute to our safety and security,\" says William Enck, co-author of a paper on the discovery and an associate professor of computer science at NC State. \"But we've found that there are widespread flaws in the design of these devices that can prevent them from notifying homeowners about problems or performing other security functions.\"<br /><br />\"Essentially, the devices are designed with the assumption that wireless connectivity is secure and won't be disrupted -- which isn't always the case,\" says Bradley Reaves, co-author of the paper and an assistant professor of computer science at NC State. \"However, we have identified potential solutions that can address these vulnerabilities.\"<br /><br />Specifically, the researchers have found that if third parties can hack a home's router -- or already know the password -- they can upload network layer suppression malware to the router. The malware allows devices to upload their \"heartbeat\" signals, signifying that they are online and functional -- but it blocks signals related to security, such as when a motion sensor is activated. These suppression attacks can be done on-site or remotely.<br /><br />\"One reason these attacks are so problematic is that the system is telling homeowners that everything is OK, regardless of what's actually happening in the home,\" Enck says.<br /><br />These network layer suppression attacks are possible because, for many IoT devices, it's easy to distinguish heartbeat signals from other signals. And addressing that design feature may point the way toward a solution.<br /><br />\"One potential fix would be to make heartbeat signals indistinguishable from other signals, so malware couldn't selectively allow heartbeat signals to pass through,\" says TJ O'Connor, first author of the paper and a Ph.D. student at NC State.<br /><br />\"Another approach would be to include more information in the heartbeat signal,\" O'Connor says. \"For example, if a device sends three motion-sensor alerts, the subsequent heartbeat signal would include data noting that three sensor alerts had been sent. Even if the network layer suppression malware blocked the sensor alert signals, the system would see the heartbeat signal and know that three sensor alerts were sent but not received. This could then trigger a system warning for homeowners.\"<br /><br />\"No system is going to be perfect, but given the widespread adoption of IoT devices, we think it's important to raise awareness of countermeasures that device designers can use to reduce their exposure to attacks,\" Enck says.<br /><br />The paper, \"Blinded and Confused: Uncovering Systemic Flaws in Device Telemetry for Smart-Home Internet of Things,\" will be presented at the 12th ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks (WiSec '19), being held May 15-17 in Miami, Fla.<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

And protecting data is even more important for military personnel, whose lives could be in danger if some types of information were to get into the wrong hands. Now, one group reports in ACS Nano a new way to protect data, especially when it is subjected to extreme environmental conditions.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />According to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, the financial loss from cybercrime in the U.S. was over $1.3 billion in 2016. As this number is only expected to rise in the upcoming years, the military, businesses and individuals are seeking new ways to guard their information. Traditional methods involve installing software, but that can require frequent updates and large amounts of power. As a result, experts have proposed alternative security methods based on hardware. Physical unclonable function (PUF) devices hold promise. Random physical variations occur as this type of hardware is fabricated, which creates a unique structure that is impossible to copy or clone. But current PUFs are sensitive to harsh environments, making them a bad choice for military or outside use. So Yang-Kyu Choi and colleagues wanted to make new PUF hardware that would overcome this challenge.<br /><br />The researchers designed a PUF based on nano-electro mechanical switches (NEMs), which are often used in circuits and are known for their low power consumption. A nanowire in the contraption floats between two gates. As the liquid used in the fabrication process naturally evaporates, the wire bends and adheres to one of the gates. Depending on which gate the nanowire is touching, a 0 or a 1 is generated. An array of several gates and nanowires can create an unpredictable, unique code. The NEM-PUF withstood exposure to high temperatures, microwaves and high-dose radiation. In the case of a data breach, it can self-destruct, providing an additional layer of security.<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

And if you're like most consumers, chances are you did nothing in response, says an Iowa State University researcher.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />Cyberattacks are so prevalent that Rui Chen, an associate professor of information systems in ISU's Ivy College of Business, says consumers are experiencing data breach fatigue. Chen and colleagues at the University of Texas at San Antonio (Eric Bachura, Rohit Valecha, H. Raghav Rao) are working to understand this behavior. Based on industry research, they know many consumers do not change their passwords or sign up for identity theft protection.<br /><br />\"When a data breach happens they're not motivated to take any corrective or protective action,\" Chen said. \"They don't use a stronger password and change it more often or check their credit files. When this happens society pays, and criminals are the only ones who benefit.\"<br /><br />Retailers are not the only targets of these data breaches. Hackers have hit medical facilities, government agencies and email providers. With so much personal information digitized and stored online, Chen says breaches are now the norm for consumers and breach fatigue creates an ever-growing opportunity for cyber criminals.<br /><br />Chen and his colleagues received funding from the National Science Foundation to study public response to the 2015 data breach at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which affected 21.5 million people. In a paper, recognized for best paper at the 2017 Americas Conference of Information Systems, the researchers outlined a consumer response model to crisis events, such as data breaches, based on the five stages of grief.<br /><br />Social media and public sentiment<br /><br />The research team examined more than 18,000 tweets posted on Twitter over a two-month period that included the hashtag #OPMHack. Chen says the tweets -- limited at that time to 140 characters -- were ideal for gauging public sentiment (anxiety, anger and sadness) and testing their model. The two-month period started with public notification about the breach and included five significant events, such as the OPM director's resignation.<br /><br />Researchers expected to see fluctuations in Twitter activity based on these events, but what stood out was the drop-off rate following each spike. Chen says the drop-off rate after the news first broke was around 35 percent, which means consumers were no longer engaged on social media and commenting on the breach. Near the end of the two-month period, the drop-off rate hit 84 percent.<br /><br />\"The quick drop off in engagement indicates either an acceptance of the breach event or an apathetic tendency toward it, as would be expected with the onset of breach fatigue,\" Chen said.<br /><br />Analysis of the tweets found heightened levels of anxiety, followed by anger and then sadness. Chen says the tweets also provided a comparison between direct victims of the OPM data breach and others commenting on social media. The researchers did not see a difference between the groups when measuring anxiety and anger, but there was a significant difference in sadness, which was higher in the victim group.<br /><br />The research team is surveying victims of the OPM and the Yahoo! data breach to learn more about how data breach fatigue affects behavior. The work may help improve interventions to change consumer behavior and limit the economic costs associated with these breaches, Chen said. It is also important for future policy intended to crack down on cybercrime.<br /><br />\"If people don't care about data breaches, lawmakers will have no motivation to beef up laws to protect against cyberthreats,\" Chen said.<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

The study addresses increasing concerns about the proliferation of drone use for personal and business applications and how it is impinging on privacy and safety.<br /><br />Share:FULL STORYA new technique to detect a drone camera illicitly capturing video is revealed in a new study published by Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) and Weizmann Institute of Science cyber security researchers. The study addresses increasing concerns about the proliferation of drone use for personal and business applications and how it is impinging on privacy and safety.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />In a new paper, \"Game of Drones -- Detecting Captured Target from an Encrypted Video Stream,\" the researchers demonstrate techniques for detecting if a targeted subject or house is being recorded by a drone camera.<br /><br />\"The beauty of this research is that someone using only a laptop and an object that flickers can detect if someone is using a drone to spy on them,\" says Ben Nassi, a Ph.D. student in the BGU Department of Software and Information Systems Engineering and a researcher at the BGU Cyber Security Research Center (CSRC). \"While it has been possible to detect a drone, now someone can also tell if it is recording a video of your location or something else.\"<br /><br />In the first demo, researchers show how a privacy invasion against a house can be detected. They used smart film placed on a window and entered a few software commands on a laptop to access the encrypted video the drone operator sees, called the FPV channel. This enabled the researchers to demonstrate how they detect that a neighbor is using a DJI Mavic drone to capture images of his own home and then illicitly stream video of his neighbor's house, as well. Click here to watch a video of the demonstration.<br /><br />In a second outdoor test, researchers demonstrate how an LED strip attached to a person wearing a white shirt can be used to detect targeted drone activity. When researchers flickered the LED lights on the cyber-shirt, it caused the FPV channel to send an \"SOS\" by modulating changes in data sent by the flickering lights.<br /><br />\"This research shatters the commonly held belief that using encryption to secure the FPV channel prevents someone from knowing they are being tracked,\" Nassi says. \"The secret behind our method is to force controlled physical changes to the captured target that influence the bitrate (data) transmitted on the FPV channel.\"<br /><br />This method can be used on any laptop that runs Linux OS and does not require any sophisticated hacking or cryptographic breaking skills.<br /><br />\"Our findings may help thwart privacy invasion attacks that are becoming more common with increasing drone use,\" Nassi says. \"This could have significant impact for the military and for consumers because a victim can now legally prove that a neighbor was invading their privacy.\"<br /><br />In previous research, Nassi showed how a laser mounted to a DJI Inspire 1 drone can use malware installed on an isolated (air-gapped) network scanner.<br /><br />The research team also included Raz Ben-Netanel, a student in the BGU Department of Communication Systems Engineering, and Prof. Yuval Elovici, director of the BGU Cyber Security Research Center.

Co-authors of the study are Evan Perkoski, assistant professor of political science at UConn, and Michael Poznansky, assistant professor of political science at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Affairs.<br /><br />Among the findings of the study:    Both states and non-state actors face similar decisions in the lifecycle of a cyberattack, yet the characteristics of each can cause their strategies to diverge, \"particularly with the optics of credit claiming.\"    While most research treats cyber operations as distinct from more traditional elements of state power, states \"may be able to leverage their cyber assets to achieve many of the same goals most frequently pursued with conventional forces.\"    The decision to privately or publicly acknowledge sponsorship of an attack may provide \"crucial information about both their motives and identity.\"Perkoski says that in developing the study, a distinction was drawn between cybercrime and cyberblackmail because \"they are inherently different forms of cyber operations with different goals in mind.\"<br /><br />He notes that typically the goal of cybercrime is personal or financial gain, which does not follow the same logic as states operating against other states in cyberspace. In the case of cyberblackmail, the attacker wants the victim to know something was stolen, such as when North Korea hacked into the servers at Sony following the release of \"The Interview,\" a film about assassinating its leader, Kim Jong-un.<br /><br />\"They hacked into Sony servers, stole certain information, and said we want you to do X or we'll release this information,\" Perkoski says. \"It was a form of pretty basic blackmail. It's not operating on the same kind of pattern of state-on-state or non-state-on-state intervention in cyberspace. In that case, you only want to communicate with the person you've hacked and let them know you have this material. It's a different dynamic than a state trying to coerce an opponent to give up their nuclear arms program.\"<br /><br />The researchers began their collaboration studying cybersecurity several years ago while they were both fellows at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Perkoski is a specialist in political violence and terrorism, while Poznansky studies clandestine and covert interventions.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />Perkoski says the alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election fits into the study's findings. Russian operatives reportedly hacked into the Democratic National Committee computers to obtain emails from the Hillary Clinton campaign, and then used social media trolls to sway public opinion toward Donald J. Trump's campaign.<br /><br />\"Russia wouldn't get as many benefits from claiming their operation,\" he says. \"They're not looking to get attention for their message or cause. They're really looking to influence the way events might unfold. Because it's unclear, it makes it hard for the U.S. to take a hard stance against them. You can always play devil's advocate and say maybe it wasn't Russia, as President Trump has said. Maybe it was some guy in his basement hacking on his own. In that case, it makes sense that Russia doesn't want to claim credit, to limit possible escalatory dynamics.\"<br /><br />One of the challenges in confirming clandestine state-sponsored activities is that it may only be possible from classified documents. Perkoski says scholars are still learning important details about historic events with the release of classified documents decades after the events occurred, such as the recent release of documents concerning the controversial 1961 U.S. invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs.<br /><br />\"When we think about what's happening with the U.S. and Russia, Iran, and North Korea and their cyber operations, it may be another 30 or 40 years until we know what's really going on,\" he says.<br /><br />Perkoski says the study helps to clarify the fact that not all cyber operations are inherently anonymous, and that actors may claim credit for them, which then opens the door to using cyber tools as almost traditional instruments of state power. At the same time, there is no firm understanding of how non-state actor groups operate in cyberspace.<br /><br />\"We know a lot about how terrorists and insurgent groups come together, and what sustains them, but we don't have a theory of any of this stuff for a hacking organization and whether they follow the same paradigms or not,\" Perkoski says. \"How do you defeat a militant organization or a hacking collective like Anonymous when they're all spread out around the world, they operate in states that don't have extradition treaties with the United States, and they might even operate in some states that give them de facto immunity? We know, for instance, that some Russian hackers don't get support from the government, but they allow them to operate freely because they're operating in Russia's own interest. That raises a lot of questions about understanding these groups.\"<br /><br />At the same time, Perkoski says, as advances in cybersecurity improve the ability of government and law enforcement agencies to track hackers, terror groups and militant organizations are moving away from technology.<br /><br />\"There was a period when government agencies were quite effective at using these tools to their advantage and gaining information. Now I think you're seeing militant groups respond to that and go more low-tech, to avoid some of those weaknesses,\" he says. \"Look at how the U.S. found Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. It wasn't through hacking or satellite imagery. It was by tracking a courier going to his house and meeting with other guys who would go back to Afghanistan. It was very much traditional signals intelligence that the CIA has been using for 50 to 60 years.\"<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

In the attacks, hackers detect variations of power and electromagnetic radiation in electronic devices' hardware and use that variation to steal encrypted information.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />Researchers with the University of Wyoming and the University of Cincinnati recently published their work in the Institute of Engineering and Technology Journal.<br /><br />Electronic devices appear more secure than ever before. Devices that used to rely on passwords now use Touch ID, or even face recognition software. Unlocking our phones is like entering a 21st century Batcave, with high-tech security measures guarding the entry.<br /><br />But protecting software is only one part of electronic security. Hardware is also susceptible to attacks.<br /><br />\"In general, we believe that because we write secure software, we can secure everything,\" said University of Wyoming assistant professor Mike Borowczak, Ph.D., who graduated from UC. He and his advisor, UC professor Ranga Vemuri, Ph.D., led the project.<br /><br />\"Regardless of how secure you can make your software, if your hardware leaks information, you can basically bypass all those security mechanisms,\" Borowczak said.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />Devices such as remote car keys, cable boxes and even credit card chips are all vulnerable to hardware attacks, typically because of their design. These devices are small and lightweight and operate on minimal power. Engineers optimize designs so the devices can work within these low-power constraints.<br /><br />\"The problem is if you try to absolutely minimize all the time, you're basically selectively optimizing,\" Borowczak said. \"You're optimizing for speed, power, area and cost, but you're taking a hit on security.\"<br /><br />When something like a cable box first turns on, it's decoding and encoding specific manufacturer information tied to its security. This decoding and encoding process draws more power and emits more electromagnetic radiation than when all of the other functions are on. Over time, these variations in power and radiation create a pattern unique to that cable box, and that unique signature is exactly what hackers are looking for.<br /><br />\"If you could steal information from something like a DVR early on, you could basically use it to reverse engineer and figure out how the decryption was happening,\" Borowczak said.<br /><br />Hackers don't need physical access to a device to take this information. Attackers can remotely detect frequencies in car keys and break into a car from more than 100 yards away.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />To secure the hardware in these devices, Vemuri and Borowczak went back to square-one: these devices' designs.<br /><br />Borowczak and Vemuri aim to restructure the design and code devices in a way that doesn't leak any information. To do this, they developed an algorithm that provides more secure hardware.<br /><br />\"You take the design specification and restructure it at an algorithmic level, so that the algorithm, no matter how it is implemented, draws the same amount of power in every cycle,\" Vemuri said. \"We've basically equalized the amount of power consumed across all the cycles, whereby even if attackers have power measurements, they can't do anything with that information.\"<br /><br />What's left is a more secure device with a more automated design. Rather than manually securing each hardware component, the algorithm automates the process. On top of that, a device created using this algorithm only uses about 5 percent more power than an insecure device, making the work commercially viable.<br /><br />Software and hardware security is an ongoing game of cat and mouse: As security technologies improve, hackers eventually find ways around these barriers. Hardware security is further complicated by the expanding network of devices and their interactivity, also known as the Internet of Things.<br /><br />Innovative research like the work by Vemuri and Borowczak can give people an extra layer of safety and security in a world of connected devices.<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

With the right amount of social engineering, it's easy to obtain crucial and sensitive information from an unsuspecting recipient with a simple request.<br /><br />Share:FULL STORYIn this age of cyberattacks and data breaches, most email users are on the lookout for, and understand the potential risks of, messages and attachments coming from unfamiliar sources.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />However, that vigilance alone might not be enough to keep you protected, according to new research from Virginia Tech that examines the growing sophistication of phishing attacks.<br /><br />Along with savvier writing, now enterprising hackers can spoof the email address of a trusted friend, co-worker, or business and send forged emails to victims. With the right amount of social engineering, it's easy to obtain crucial and sensitive information from an unsuspecting recipient with a simple request.<br /><br />\"These kinds of phishing attacks are especially dangerous,\" said Gang Wang, an assistant professor of computer science in Virginia Tech's College of Engineering. \"Technology changes so quickly, and now a hacker can obtain your information easily. This information can be used to commit cyberattacks that run the gamut from being mildly annoying, like having to deal with a checking account that has been hacked, to serious consequences of physical life and death if information, for example, to a hospital's computer mainframe is obtained.\"<br /><br />One of Wang's research areas is currently focused on studying how to thwart these attacks. He will present a paper on his recent findings at the 27th Annual USENIX Security Symposium in Baltimore, Maryland, in August.<br /><br />Phishing attacks have involved nearly half of the more than 2,000 confirmed security breaches reported by Verizon in the last two years. These breaches cause leakage of billions of records and cost millions of dollars to rectify depending on the industry affected and its geographic location.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />Spoofing, where the attacker impersonates a trusted entity, is a critical step in executing phishing attacks. Today's email system has no mechanism to fully prevent spoofing.<br /><br />\"The SMTP system we are using today was designed without security in mind,\" said Wang. \"That's something that has plagued the system since its inception.\"<br /><br />Security measures were put into place to guard against spoofing attacks after the fact and rely on email providers to implement strategies using SMTP extensions, such as SPF (sender policy framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication), to authenticate the sender. Measurements conducted by the research team in 2018 indicate that among Alexa's top 1 million domains, 45 percent have SPF, 5 percent have DMARC, and even fewer are configured correctly or strictly.<br /><br />For the study, the research teams' methodology was centered on setting up end-to-end spoofing experiments on popular email providers that are used by billions of users. They did this by setting up user accounts under the target email services as the email receiver and using an experimental server to send forged emails, with a fake sender address, to the receiver account.<br /><br />The spoofed sender address is the key to the study as this is a critical part of the authentication process. If the spoofed domain has a valid SPF, DKIM, or DMARC record, then the receiver, in theory, is able to detect spoofing.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />Spoofing can be done using existing contacts or the same email provider as the intended recipient.<br /><br />To this end, researchers used five different types of email content for the study: a blank email, a blank email with a benign URL, a blank email with a benign attachment, a benign email with actual content, and a phishing email with content that impersonates technical support to notify and rectify a security breach by being directed to a URL.<br /><br />In total, the study used 35 popular email services, such as Gmail, iCloud, and Outlook. The researchers found that email providers tend to favor email delivery over security. When an email failed authentication, most email providers, including Gmail and iCloud, still delivered the email as long as the protocol of the spoofed domain was not to reject it.<br /><br />The researchers also found that only six email services have displayed security indicators on forged emails, including Gmail, Protonmail, Naver, Mail.ru, , and . Only four email services consistently display security indicators on their mobile email apps. Human factors still remain a weak link in the end-to-end process, so the research team framed the study to understand users' email habits.<br /><br />In Wang's study, the click-through rate for people who received the email with a security indicator was 17.9 percent. Without a security cue, the rate was 26.1 percent. Because not everyone who received a phishing email opened the email, the team also calculated the click-through rate on all users who opened the email, resulting in higher rates of 48.9 percent and 37.2 percent.<br /><br />Recommendations from the study include adoption of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to authenticate emails, and if an email is delivered to an inbox, email providers should place a security indicator, such as Google's red question mark on the email, to warn users of the potential risks.<br /><br />The team also recommended consistency among email providers for different interfaces. Currently mobile users are exposed to higher level of risks due to the lack of security indicators. And finally, the study recommended that misleading elements, such as a \"profile photo\" and email \"history,\" be disabled on suspicious emails.<br /><br />With so many emails being delivered on a daily basis, it's surprising that there aren't more successful phishing campaigns.<br /><br />\"It really only takes one email to cause a security breach,\" said Wang.<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

The researchers were surprised to find that almost 1 percent of the websites they tested had suffered a data breach during their 18-month study period, regardless of how big the companies' reach and audience are.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />\"No one is above this -- companies or nation states -- it's going to happen; it's just a question of when,\" said Alex C. Snoeren, the paper's senior author and a professor of computer science at the Jacobs School of Engineering at the University of California San Diego.<br /><br />One percent might not seem like much. But given that there are over a billion sites on the Internet, this means tens of millions of websites could be breached every year, said Joe DeBlasio, one of Snoeren's Ph.D. students and the paper's first author.<br /><br />Even scarier, the researchers found that popular sites were just as likely to be hacked as unpopular ones. This means that out of the top-1000 most visited sites on the Internet, ten are likely to be hacked every year.<br /><br />\"One percent of the really big shops getting owned is terrifying,\" DeBlasio said.<br /><br />The team of researchers at UC San Diego presented the tool in November at ACM Internet Measurement Conference in London.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />The concept behind the tool, called Tripwire, is relatively simple. DeBlasio created a bot that registers and creates accounts on a large number of websites -- around 2,300 were included in their study. Each account is associated with a unique email address. The tool was designed to use the same password for the email account and the website account associated with that email. Researchers then waited to see if an outside party used the password to access the email account. This would indicate that the website's account information had been leaked.<br /><br />To make sure that the breach was related to hacked websites and not the email provider or their own infrastructure, researchers set up a control group. It consisted of more than 100,000 email accounts they created with the same email provider used in the study. But computer scientists did not use the addresses to register on websites. None of these email accounts were accessed by hackers.<br /><br />In the end, researchers determined 19 websites had been hacked, including a well-known American startup with more than 45 million active customers.<br /><br />Once the accounts were breached, researchers got in touch with the sites' security teams to warn them of the breaches. They exchanged emails and phone calls. \"I was heartened that the big sites we interacted with took us seriously,\" Snoeren said.<br /><br />Yet none of the websites chose to disclose to their customers the breach the researchers had uncovered. \"I was somewhat surprised no one acted on our results,\" Snoeren said.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />The researchers decided not to name the companies in their study.<br /><br />\"The reality is that these companies didn't volunteer to be part of this study,\" Snoeren said. \"By doing this, we've opened them up to huge financial and legal exposure. So we decided to put the onus on them to disclose.\"<br /><br />Interestingly, very few of the breached accounts were used to send spam once they became vulnerable. Instead, the hackers usually just monitored email traffic. DeBlasio speculates that the hackers were monitoring emails to harvest valuable information, such as bank and credit card accounts.<br /><br />Researchers went a step further. They created at least two accounts per website. One account had an \"easy\" password -- strings of seven-character words with their first letter capitalized and followed by a single digit. These kinds of passwords are usually the first passwords that hackers will guess. The other account had a \"hard\" password -- random 10-character strings of numbers and letters, both in lower and upper case, without special characters.<br /><br />Seeing which of the two accounts got breached allowed researchers to make a good guess about how websites store passwords. If both the easy and hard passwords were hacked, the website likely just stores passwords in plain text, contrary to typically-followed best practice. If only the account using the easy password was breached, the sites likely used a more sophisticated method for password storage: an algorithm that turns passwords into a random string of data -- with random information added to those strings.<br /><br />The computer scientists had a few pieces of advice for Internet users: don't reuse passwords; use a password manager; and ask yourself how much you really need to disclose online.<br /><br />\"Websites ask for a lot of information,\" Snoeren said. \"Why do they need to know your mother's real maiden name and the name of your dog?\"<br /><br />DeBlasio was less optimistic that these precautions would work.<br /><br />\"The truth of the matter is that your information is going to get out; and you're not going to know that it got out,\" he said.<br /><br />Snoeren and colleagues are not planning to pursue further research on Tripwire.<br /><br />\"We hope to have impact through companies picking it up and using it themselves,\" he said. \"Any major email provider can provide this service.\"<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />Materials provided by .

But given that there are over a billion sites on the Internet, this means tens of millions of websites could be breached every year, said Joe DeBlasio, one of Snoeren's Ph.D. students and the paper's first author.<br /><br />Even scarier, the researchers found that popular sites were just as likely to be hacked as unpopular ones. This means that out of the top-1000 most visited sites on the Internet, ten are likely to be hacked every year.<br /><br />\"One percent of the really big shops getting owned is terrifying,\" DeBlasio said.<br /><br />The team of researchers at UC San Diego presented the tool in November at ACM Internet Measurement Conference in London.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />The concept behind the tool, called Tripwire, is relatively simple. DeBlasio created a bot that registers and creates accounts on a large number of websites -- around 2,300 were included in their study. Each account is associated with a unique email address. The tool was designed to use the same password for the email account and the website account associated with that email. Researchers then waited to see if an outside party used the password to access the email account. This would indicate that the website's account information had been leaked.<br /><br />To make sure that the breach was related to hacked websites and not the email provider or their own infrastructure, researchers set up a control group. It consisted of more than 100,000 email accounts they created with the same email provider used in the study. But computer scientists did not use the addresses to register on websites. None of these email accounts were accessed by hackers.<br /><br />In the end, researchers determined 19 websites had been hacked, including a well-known American startup with more than 45 million active customers.<br /><br />Once the accounts were breached, researchers got in touch with the sites' security teams to warn them of the breaches. They exchanged emails and phone calls. \"I was heartened that the big sites we interacted with took us seriously,\" Snoeren said.<br /><br />Yet none of the websites chose to disclose to their customers the breach the researchers had uncovered. \"I was somewhat surprised no one acted on our results,\" Snoeren said.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />The researchers decided not to name the companies in their study.<br /><br />\"The reality is that these companies didn't volunteer to be part of this study,\" Snoeren said. \"By doing this, we've opened them up to huge financial and legal exposure. So we decided to put the onus on them to disclose.\"<br /><br />Interestingly, very few of the breached accounts were used to send spam once they became vulnerable. Instead, the hackers usually just monitored email traffic. DeBlasio speculates that the hackers were monitoring emails to harvest valuable information, such as bank and credit card accounts.<br /><br />Researchers went a step further. They created at least two accounts per website. One account had an \"easy\" password -- strings of seven-character words with their first letter capitalized and followed by a single digit. These kinds of passwords are usually the first passwords that hackers will guess. The other account had a \"hard\" password -- random 10-character strings of numbers and letters, both in lower and upper case, without special characters.<br /><br />Seeing which of the two accounts got breached allowed researchers to make a good guess about how websites store passwords. If both the easy and hard passwords were hacked, the website likely just stores passwords in plain text, contrary to typically-followed best practice. If only the account using the easy password was breached, the sites likely used a more sophisticated method for password storage: an algorithm that turns passwords into a random string of data -- with random information added to those strings.<br /><br />The computer scientists had a few pieces of advice for Internet users: don't reuse passwords; use a password manager; and ask yourself how much you really need to disclose online.<br /><br />\"Websites ask for a lot of information,\" Snoeren said. \"Why do they need to know your mother's real maiden name and the name of your dog?\"<br /><br />DeBlasio was less optimistic that these precautions would work.<br /><br />\"The truth of the matter is that your information is going to get out; and you're not going to know that it got out,\" he said.<br /><br />Snoeren and colleagues are not planning to pursue further research on Tripwire.<br /><br />\"We hope to have impact through companies picking it up and using it themselves,\" he said. \"Any major email provider can provide this service.\"<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />Materials provided by .

According to IBM and the Ponemon Institute, the average cost of a data breach for companies in 2017 was more than $3.5 million.<br /><br />Give employees a reason to care<br /><br />A recent study published in the Journal of Management Information Systems suggests information security managers and supervisors could have greater success in motivating employees to act more securely by avoiding cold, authoritative commands, and instead create security messages that are relatable and provide options for how employees can better protect information and respond to threats.<br /><br />According to Washington State University researcher and co-author Rob Crossler, Carson College of Business assistant professor of information systems, employees may fail to realize they are putting company data at risk or have less of an interest in taking steps to ensure security because it's not their personal data.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />\"If you want people inside an organization to truly change their security behaviors, you have to give them a reason to care,\" said Crossler. \"You have to get them motivated in order to be effective at changing behaviors.\"<br /><br />Choices not mandates<br /><br />According to Crossler, when employees feel they have a choice in their response in what works best for them, they tend to take actions that are more secure.<br /><br />He recommends information systems managers avoid messaging that is too rigid in its instruction, and instead focuses on different strategies for protecting information and responding to threats. For example:<br /><br />Your passwords are the keys to your digital life, and your online accounts are a proverbial gold mine for someone looking to steal your identity. Hackers often accomplish identity theft by figuring out online passwords. Regardless of how confident you are in your computer skills, you can learn how to create strong passwords and manage them using a password manager. A password manager is software that aids in keeping track of multiple passwords. We recommend using Dashlane, 1Password, KeePass or LastPass. Each of these is an adequate solution, so feel free to choose the software you like the best as your password manager.<br /><br />The goal is \"changing the conversation to be about a partnership,\" Crossler said. \"The focus should be 'We are in this together, and you have options on what you can do to help,' as opposed to 'You have to do this or that.'\"<br /><br />Better security not perfection<br /><br />\"When it comes to securing what you are doing, we are all going to fail. We are not going to be perfect. Phishing attacks are getting so good that even the most alert individual is going to make a mistake,\" he said. \"If they fail in their actions, employees should be encouraged to immediately report it and do the right thing without fear of being reprimanded.\"<br /><br />Organizations can work to safeguard against security threats and encourage their employees to make better decisions by providing information and security training on a more frequent, year-round basis, said Crossler. Managers and supervisors also can find the latest information on security issues and threats, as well as access up-to-date education and training resources, on the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team website ().<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

Researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Singtel, Asia's leading communications technology group, have demonstrated a technique that will help pairs of light particles smoothly navigate these networks, a breakthrough that will enable stronger cyber security. The demonstration was performed over 10km of Singtel's fibre network. This project, conducted in Singapore, is driven by the NUS-Singtel Cyber Security Research &amp; Development Laboratory, a public-private partnership supported by the National Research Foundation, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore. It relies on the expertise from the Centre for Quantum Technologies (CQT) at NUS.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />This new approach supports the deployment of a technology known as quantum key distribution (QKD). Transmitted over fibre networks, it uses signals sent in particles of light known as photons. Detection of individual photons creates encryption keys for secure communication. Data encrypted with such keys is resistant to all computational hacks.<br /><br />QKD trials are being conducted worldwide as governments and companies recognise the need to strengthen their cyber security. The QKD trials carried out by the NUS-Singtel team use pairs of photons that are connected by the quantum property of entanglement. Most QKD schemes require that the sender and receiver of a secret message exchange photons directly or trust the source of their keys. With this alternative approach, it is possible to check the security of a key provided by a third party supplier.<br /><br />It works like this: the supplier would create a pair of photons, then split them up, sending one each to the two parties that want to communicate securely. The entanglement means that when the parties measure their photons, they get matching results, either a 0 or 1. Doing this for many photons leaves each party with identical patterns of 0s and 1s, giving them a key to lock and unlock a message.<br /><br />Typically, each photon encounters a different obstacle course of spliced fibre segments and junction boxes. On their paths, the photons also suffer dispersion, where they effectively spread out. This affects the operators' ability to track the photons.<br /><br />The new trick, published on 4 April in the scientific journal Applied Physics Letters, keeps the entangled photons in sync as they travel different paths through the network. This is important because they are identified by the gap between their arrival times at the detector. \"Timing information is what allows us to link pairs of detection events together. Preserving this correlation will help us to create encryption keys faster,\" says James Grieve, a researcher on the team.<br /><br />The technique works by carefully designing the photon source to create pairs of light particles with colours either side of a known feature of optical fibre called the 'zero-dispersion wavelength'. Normally, in optical fibres bluer light would arrive faster than redder light, spreading out the photons' arrival times. Working around the zero-dispersion point makes it possible to match the speeds through the photons' time-energy entanglement. Then the timing is preserved.<br /><br />Associate Professor Alexander Ling, a Principal Investigator at CQT, led this work for the NUS-Singtel lab. He said, \"Before these results, it was not known if the multi-segment nature of deployed fibre would enable high precision dispersion cancellation, because the segments don't generally have identical zero dispersion wavelengths.\"<br /><br />In showing it can work, the team boosts expectations for QKD over commercial fibre. The entangled photons could find other applications, too. For example, the photons in each pair are created within femtoseconds of each other. Their coordinated arrival times might synchronise clocks for time-critical operations such as financial trading.<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />Materials provided by .

But a new study from SMU (Southern Methodist University) suggests that it's possible to access your information in a much subtler way: by using a nearby smart phone to intercept the sound of your typing.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />Researchers from SMU's Darwin Deason Institute for Cybersecurity found that acoustic signals, or sound waves, produced when we type on a computer keyboard can successfully be picked up by a smartphone. The sounds intercepted by the phone can then be processed, allowing a skilled hacker to decipher which keys were struck and what they were typing.<br /><br />The researchers were able to decode much of what was being typed using common keyboards and smartphones -- even in a noisy conference room filled with the sounds of other people typing and having conversations.<br /><br />\"We were able to pick up what people are typing at a 41 percent word accuracy rate. And we can extend that out -- above 41 percent -- if we look at, say, the top 10 words of what we think it might be,\" said Eric C. Larson, one of the two lead authors and an assistant professor in SMU Lyle School's Department of Computer Science.<br /><br />The study was published in the June edition of the journal Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies. Co-authors of the study are Tyler Giallanza, Travis Siems, Elena Sharp, Erik Gabrielsen and Ian Johnson -- all current or former students at the Deason Institute.<br /><br />It might take only a couple of seconds to obtain information on what you're typing, noted lead author Mitch Thornton, director of SMU's Deason Institute and professor of electrical and computer engineering.<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />\"Based on what we found, I think smartphone makers are going to have to go back to the drawing board and make sure they are enhancing the privacy with which people have access to these sensors in a smartphone,\" Larson said.<br /><br />The researchers wanted to create a scenario that would mimic what might happen in real life. So they arranged several people in a conference room, talking to each other and taking notes on a laptop. Placed on the same table as their laptop or computer, were as many as eight mobile phones, kept anywhere from three inches to several feet feet away from the computer, Thornton said.<br /><br />Study participants were not given a script of what to say when they were talking, and were allowed to use shorthand or full sentences when typing. They were also allowed to either correct typewritten errors or leave them, as they saw fit.<br /><br />\"We were looking at security holes that might exist when you have these 'always-on' sensing devices -- that being your smartphone,\" Larson said. \"We wanted to understand if what you're typing on your laptop, or any keyboard for that matter, could be sensed by just those mobile phones that are sitting on the same table.<br /><br />\"The answer was a definite, \"Yes.\"<br /><br />But just how does it work?<br /><br />advertisement<br /><br />\"There are many kinds of sensors in smartphones that cause the phone to know its orientation and to detect when it is sitting still on a table or being carried in someone's pocket. Some sensors require the user to give permission to turn them on, but many of them are always turned on,\" Thornton explained. \"We used sensors that are always turned on, so all we had to do was develop a new app that processed the sensor output to predict the key that was pressed by a typist.\"<br /><br />There are some caveats, though.<br /><br />\"An attacker would need to know the material type of the table,\" Larson said, because different tables create different sound waves when you type. For instance, a wooden table like the kind used in this study sounds different than someone typing on a metal tabletop.<br /><br />Larson said, \"An attacker would also need a way of knowing there are multiple phones on the table and how to sample from them.\"<br /><br />A successful interception of this sort could potentially be very scary, Thornton noted, because \"there's no way to know if you're being hacked this way.\"<br /><br />The Deason Institute is part of SMU's Lyle School of Engineering, and its mission is to to advance the science, policy, application and education of cyber security through basic and problem-driven, interdisciplinary research.<br /><br />make a difference: sponsored opportunity<br /><br />Story Source:<br /><br />provided by .

China\u2019s intelligence services and Chinese cyber actors could exploit Chinese Government-supported telecommunication equipment on US networks operating as an advanced persistent threat. China makes no secret that its cyber warfare strategy is predicated on controlling global communications network infrastructure.<br /><br />(U) Since Huawei\u2019s inception in 1987, the company continues to receive open support from senior Chinese Communist Party officials and People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) Commanders. Bolstered by Chinese Government subsidization and direct financing, Huawei is able to offer unsuspecting US businesses low-cost offers in exchange for access to US networks.<br /><br />(U) The purpose of this SPIN is to provide summaries of recent US investigative findings, private industry reporting, and news articles on Huawei Technology Inc.<br /><br />(U) INVESTIGATIVE REPORT ON THE US NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES POSED BY CHINESE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY HUAWEI<br /><br />(U) Huawei and another China-based entity, ZTE, were both previously highlighted as concerns in a 2012 House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) report. The report noted, \u201cthe protection of intellectual property and compliance with United States export control laws are a core concern for U.S. interests. The ability of a company to comply with these laws provide a useful test of that company\u2019s ability to follow international codes of business conduct and remain free of undue state influence.\u201d<br /><br />(U) UPDATES SINCE HPSCI<br /><br />(U//FOUO) FBI Director Wray\u2019s Senate testimony at the Senate Intelligence Committee in February 2018 demonstrates that the US government remains concerned about the security risks posed by Chinese telecommunications companies.<br /><br />(U) In January 2018, daft bill HR4747, also known as the \u201cDefending US Government Communications Act,\u201d was introduced in the US House of Representatives. The bill cites reporting indicating that PRC companies Huawei and ZTE are \u201csubject to state influence.\u201d It would prevent the use or procurement of any telecommunications equipment or services from Huawei or ZTE as a \u201csubstantial or essential component of any system, or as critical technology as part of any system\u201d as related to USG contracts.<br /><br />(U) The draft Senate version of the bill, S.2391, would prohibit USG agencies from purchasing and leasing hardware and services made by ZTE, Huawei and any affiliates and subsidiaries.<br /><br />(U//FOUO) PRC LAWS APPLICABLE TO CHINESE COMPANIES IN THE US<br /><br />(U) Cybersecurity Law of 2017 requires telecommunication network operators and ISPs to store data within China and allows Chinese authorities to conduct spot-checks on company network operations.<br /><br />(U) PRC National Security Law of 2015 calls for citizens and organizations to provide information or other assistance for Chinese national security works.<br /><br />(U) 2015 Chinese Counterterrorism Law requires that internet service providers (ISPs) provide technical means of support in terrorism and other national security cases.<br /><br />(U) 1996 Chinese Archive Law requires all Chinese state organizations, armed forces, political parties, social organizations, state-owned enterprises, establishments, and citizens to regularly transfer information to the Chinese government in China for record keeping and archiving. Subsidiary companies of Chinese companies are included.<br /><br />(U) BACKDOORS AND UNDISCLOSED FEATURES<br /><br />(U) Modern telecommunications are a complex ecosystem with multiple interoperable parts fulfilling different rules but all cooperating through shared standards. Any one of these parts could be a potential asset to a hostile foreign power. These inherent vulnerabilities are potentially in any equipment servicing and maintenance contracts. Additionally, manufactures regularly update most complex telecom products so even if there are no deliberate vulnerabilities now, some future update could install them. While some risks can be mitigated, it is highly unlikely that even careful inspections could identify all vulnerabilities.<br /><br />(U) DISRUPTION AND DATA EXFILTRATION<br /><br />(U//FOUO) Huawei and ZTE provide finished equipment, components, and services to network routers. Routers are used to connect users between networks, and network customers typically subscribe to an Internet service provider (ISP) to transport data between networks. If the routers were disabled, it could severely disrupt the internet, as traffic would no longer be routed between networks, except where carriers had their own private peering arrangements. Additionally, routers are comprised of integrated circuits and may include backdoors or other vulnerabilities that would allow for remote, unauthorized, and undetected access by the manufacturer or a malicious actor. These vulnerabilities could potentially allow for exfiltration of data to Chinese-based servers.<br /><br />(U) 5G TECHNOLOGIES<br /><br />(U//FOUO) Huawei could insert backdoors into current, 4G LTE, critical telecommunications infrastructure equipment it provides such as routers, switches, and phones. This could give Beijing potential access to national communications. If Huawei partners with telecommunications carriers to develop the next generation wireless network, 5G, then the backdoors could end up on far more telecommunications equipment to include cell phone towers.<br /><br />(U) HUAWEI THEFT OF US PROPRIETARY INFORMATION<br /><br />(U) T-Mobile created a phone-testing robot called Tappy that in a matter of days could test daily phone use and everyday functionality, compared to the weeks this testing used to take. As a handset supplier to T-Mobile in 2012, Huawei was granted access to the testing lab and the Tappy Robot after signing a clean room letter and non-disclosure agreements that prohibited photography, copying of source code, or any other theft of the technology.<br /><br />(U) Despite T-Mobile taking significant steps to protect its robot intellectual property, in May 2013 Huawei employees took photographs and stole T-Mobiles trade secrets including the robot finger. In 2017, T-Mobile won its civil lawsuit against Huawei, who was found to have misappropriated trade secrets belonging to T-Mobile, who was awarded $4.8 million by a jury. This shows the lengths that Huawei went to steal T-Mobile\u2019s proprietary information and how it treats its business partners, despite having signed legal agreements.<br /><br />(U) OUTLOOK AND IMPLICATIONS:<br /><br />(U) US assets are largely in the hands of the private sector, not the government. If your company or agency has information or assets that could help our adversaries advance their interests, then your company or agency is almost certainly being targeted. You must identify and protect your priority information and assets, and you should engage with your local FBI office to exchange intelligence and report suspicious activity. Prevention of harm is essential. Once a foreign country has acquired U.S. information or assets, the damage cannot be undone by punishing those who were responsible.<br /><br />Share this:<br /><br />Related Material From the Archive:<br /><br />", "publish_time": 1569727652346, "collection_time": 1569727652347, "summary": "(U) With the expanded use of Huawei Technologies Inc. equipment and services in US telecommunications service provider networks, the Chinese Government\u2019s potential access to US business communicatio", "source": "publicintelligence"}

The Committee sought to determine the extent of Russian activities, identify the response of the U.S. Government at the state, local, and federal level to the threat, and make recommendations on how to better prepare for such threats in the future. The Committee received testimony from state election officials, Obama administration officials, and those in the Intelligence Community and elsewhere in the U.S. Government responsible for evaluating threats to elections.<br /><br />The Russian government directed extensive activity, beginning in at least 2014 and carrying into at least 2017, against U.S. election infrastructure at the state and local level.<br /><br />3. (U) While the Committee does not know with confidence what Moscows intentions were, Russia may have been probing vulnerabilities in voting systems to exploit later. Alternatively, Moscow may have sought to undermine confidence in the 2016 U.S. elections simply through the discovery of their activity.<br /><br />4. (U) Russian efforts exploited the seams between federal authorities and capabilities, and protections for the states. The U.S. intelligence apparatus is, by design, foreign-facing, with limited domestic cybersecurity authorities except where the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can work with state and local partners. State election officials, who have primacy in running elections, were not sufficiently warned or prepared to handle an attack from a hostile nation-state actor.<br /><br />5. (U) DHS and FBI alerted states to the threat of cyber attacks in the late summer and fall of 2016, but the warnings did not provide enough information or go to the right people. Alerts were actionable, in that they provided malicious Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to information technology (IT) professionals, but they provided no clear reason for states to take this threat more seriously than any other alert received.<br /><br />6. (U) In 2016, officials at all levels of government debated whether publicly acknowledging this foreign activity was the right course. Some were deeply concerned that public warnings might promote the very impression they were trying to dispel\u2014that the voting systems were insecure.<br /><br />7. (U) Russian activities demand renewed attention to vulnerabilities in U.S. voting infrastructure. In 2016, cybersecurity for electoral infrastructure at the state and local level was sorely lacking; for example, voter registration databases were not as secure as they could have been. Aging voting equipment, particularly voting machines that had no paper record of votes, were vulnerable to exploitation by a committed adversary. Despite the focus on this issue since 2016, some of these vulnerabilities remain.<br /><br />8. (U) In the face of this threat and these security gaps, DHS has redoubled its efforts to build trust with states and deploy resources to assist in securing elections. Since 2016, DHS has made great strides in learning how election procedures vary across states and how federal entities can be of most help to states. The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED), and other groups have helped DHS in this effort. DHSs work to bolster states cybersecurity has likely been effective, in particular for those states that have leveraged DHSs cybersecurity assessments for election infrastructure, but much more needs to be done to coordinate state, local, and federal knowledge and efforts in order to harden states electoral infrastructure against foreign meddling.<br /><br />(U) In June 2016, Illinois experienced the first known breach by Russian actors of state election infrastructure during the 2016 election. As of the end of 2018, the Russian cyber actors had successfully penetrated Illinoiss voter registration database, viewed multiple database tables, and accessed up to 200.000 voter registration records. The compromise resulted in the exfiltration of an unknown quantity of voter registration data. Russian cyber actors were in a position to delete or change voter data, but the Committee is not aware of any evidence that they did so.<br /><br />(U) Direct-Recording Electronic (ORE) Voting Machine Vulnerabilities<br /><br />(U) While best practices dictate that electronic voting machines not be connected to the internet, some machines are internet-enabled. In addition, each machine has to be programmed before Election Day, a procedure often done either by connecting the machine to a local network to download software or by using removable media, such as a thumb drive. These functions are often carried out by local officials or contractors. If the computers responsible for writing and distributing the program are compromised, so too could all voting machines receiving a compromised update. Further, machines can be programmed to show one result to the voter while recording a different result in the tabulation. Without a paper backup, a recount would use the same faulty software to re-tabulate the same results, because the primary records of the vote are stored in computer memory.<br /><br />Share this:<br /><br />Related Material From the Archive:<br /><br />", "publish_time": 1569727640334, "collection_time": 1569727640334, "summary": "(U) From 2017 to 2019, the Committee held hearings, conducted interviews, and reviewed intelligence related to Russian attempts in 2016 to access election infrastructure.

At the heart of both bills\u2019 detainee provisions appears to be an effort to confirm or, as some observers view it, expand the detention authority that Congress implicitly granted the President via the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF, P.L. 107-40) in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.<br /><br />Congress has long been concerned about whether U.S. policy advances the national interest in reducing the role of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and missiles that could deliver them. Recipients of China\u2019s technology reportedly include Pakistan and countries said by the State Department to have supported terrorism, such as Iran. This CRS Report, updated as warranted, discusses the security problem of China\u2019s role in weapons proliferation and issues related to the U.S. policy response since the mid-1990s. China has taken some steps to mollify U.S. and other foreign concerns about its role in weapons proliferation. Nonetheless, supplies from China have aggravated trends that result in ambiguous technical aid, more indigenous capabilities, longer-range missiles, and secondary (retransferred) proliferation. According to unclassified intelligence reports submitted as required to Congress, China has been a \u201ckey supplier\u201d of technology, particularly PRC entities providing nuclear and missile-related technology to Pakistan and missile-related technology to Iran.<br /><br />The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI, the Bureau) is the lead federal law enforcement agency charged with counterterrorism investigations. Since the September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, the FBI has implemented a series of reforms intended to transform itself from a largely reactive law enforcement agency focused on investigations of criminal activity into a more proactive, agile, flexible, and intelligence-driven agency that can prevent acts of terrorism.<br /><br />Direct Overt U.S. Aid and Military Reimbursements to Pakistan, FY2002-FY2012, prepared for the Congressional Research Service by K. Alan Kronstadt, Specialist in South Asian Affairs.<br /><br />The federal government loses both individual and corporate income tax revenue from the shifting of profits and income into low-tax countries, often referred to as tax havens. The revenue losses from this tax avoidance and evasion are difficult to estimate, but some have suggested that the annual cost of offshore tax abuses may be around $100 billion per year. International tax avoidance can arise from large multinational corporations who shift profits into low-tax foreign subsidiaries or wealthy individual investors who set up secret bank accounts in tax haven countries.<br /><br />U.S. aid to Africa initially reached a peak in 1985, when global competition with the Soviet Union was at a high point. After the cold war ended, security assistance levels for Africa began to decline. In 1995, at the outset of the 104th Congress, substantial reductions in aid to Africa had been anticipated, as many questioned the importance of Africa to U.S. national security interests in the post-cold war era. As the debate went forward, however, congressional reports and bills emphasized U.S. humanitarian, economic, and other interests in Africa. Aid levels did fall, but gradually began to increase again in FY1997. U.S. assistance to Africa is reaching new highs due to a significant increase in health care sectors under the Global Health and Child Survival (GHCS) program. U.S. aid to Africa nearly quadrupled from $1.2 billion in FY2006 to $6.7 billion in FY2010. Moreover, the United States is the leading donor of humanitarian assistance to Africa. Between FY1999 and FY2009, the United States provided over $10.1 billion to East and Central African countries and an estimated $2.2 billion to Southern Africa countries.<br /><br />Major anti-government protests broke out in Libya on February 15 and have since intensified, eliciting violent government responses. The demonstrations are in opposition to the 42-year regime of Libya\u2019s leader, Muammar al Qadhafi. As of February 18, some sources have reported that opposition forces have taken over areas of Benghazi, Libya\u2019s second-largest city, and its surroundings in Libya\u2019s northeastern Mediterranean region of Cyrenaica.<br /><br />After experiencing serious unrest during the late 1990s, Bahrain undertook several steps to enhance the inclusion of the Shiite majority in governance. However, protests erupting following the uprising that overthrew Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on February 11, 2011, demonstrate that Shiite grievances over the distribution of power and economic opportunities remain unsatisfied. The new unrest comes four months after smaller protests against the efforts by the Sunni-led government\u2019s efforts to maintain its tight grip on power in the October 23, 2010, parliamentary election. That election, no matter the outcome, would not have unseated the ruling Al Khalifa family from power, but the Shiite population was hoping that winning a majority in the elected lower house could give it greater authority with which to challenge the ruling family. In advance of the elections, the government launched a wave of arrests intended to try to discredit<br /><br />some of the hard-line Shiite leadership as tools of Iran.<br /><br />In Mexico, the violence generated by drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) in recent years has been, according to some, unprecedented. In 2006, Mexico\u2019s newly elected President Felipe Calder\u00f3n launched an aggressive campaign\u2014an initiative that has defined his administration\u2014 against the DTOs that has been met with a violent response from the DTOs. Government enforcement efforts have had successes in removing some of the key leaders in all of the seven major DTOs. However, these efforts have led to violent succession struggles within the DTOs themselves. In July 2010, the Mexican government announced that more than 28,000 people had been killed in drug trafficking-related violence since December 2006, when President Calder\u00f3n came to office.<br /><br />Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah is a Shiite Islamist militia, political party, social welfare organization, and U.S. State Department-designated terrorist organization. Its armed element receives support from Iran and Syria and possesses significant paramilitary and unconventional warfare capabilities. In the wake of the summer 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah and an armed domestic confrontation between Hezbollah and rival Lebanese groups in May 2008, Lebanon\u2019s political process is now intensely focused on Hezbollah\u2019s future role in the country. Lebanese factions are working to define Hezbollah\u2019s role through a series of \u201cNational Dialogue\u201d discussions.<br /><br />,This report collects statistics from a variety of sources on casualties sustained during Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), which began on October 7, 2001, and is ongoing. OEF actions take place primarily in Afghanistan; however, OEF casualties also includes American casualties in Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Guantanamo Bay (Cuba), Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Jordan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, the Philippines, Seychelles, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Yemen.<br /><br />This report is prepared annually to provide Congress with official, unclassified, quantitative data on conventional arms transfers to developing nations by the United States and foreign countries for the preceding eight calendar years for use in its policy oversight functions. All agreement and delivery data in this report for the United States are government-to-government Foreign Military Sales (FMS) transactions. Similar data are provided on worldwide conventional arms transfers by all suppliers, but the principal focus is the level of arms transfers by major weapons suppliers to nations in the developing world.<br /><br />,Kyrgyzstan is a small and poor country in Central Asia that gained independence in 1991 with the breakup of the Soviet Union (see Figure A-1). It has developed a notable but fragile civil society. Progress in democratization has been set back by problematic elections (one of which helped precipitate a coup in 2005 that brought Kurmanbek Bakiyev to power), contention over constitutions, and corruption. The April 2010 coup appears to have been triggered by popular discontent over rising utility prices and government repression. After two days of popular unrest in the capital of Bishkek and other cities, opposition politicians ousted the Bakiyev administration on April 8 and declared an interim government pending a new presidential election in six months. Roza Otunbayeva, a former foreign minister and ambassador to the United States, was declared the acting prime minister.<br /><br />Drug trafficking is viewed as a primary threat to citizen security and U.S. interests in Latin America and the Caribbean despite decades of anti-drug efforts by the United States and partner governments. The production and trafficking of popular illicit drugs\u2014cocaine, marijuana, opiates, and methamphetamine\u2014generates a multi-billion dollar black market in which Latin American criminal and terrorist organizations thrive. These groups challenge state authority in source and transit countries where governments are often fragile and easily corrupted. Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) largely control the U.S. illicit drug market and have been identified by the U.S. Department of Justice as the \u201cgreatest organized crime threat to the United States.\u201d Drug trafficking-related crime and violence in the region has escalated in recent years, raising the drug issue to the forefront of U.S. foreign policy concerns.<br /><br />The Aegis ballistic missile defense (BMD) program, which is carried out by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and the Navy, gives Navy Aegis cruisers and destroyers a capability for conducting BMD operations. Under current MDA and Navy plans, the number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships is scheduled to grow from 20 at the end of FY2010 to 38 at the end of FY2015. MDA and Navy plans also call for an increasing portion of the Navy\u2019s BMD-capable Aegis ships to be equipped with newer and more capable versions of the Aegis BMD system.<br /><br />An emergency preparedness and response program provides resources and support to individuals and communities that might be affected by a broad range of disruptive incidents. These incidents may be caused by natural phenomena such as severe weather, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, or disease outbreaks. Incidents might result from human activity as well, and could include accidents, criminal acts, terrorism, or other attacks. Concerns have been raised whether current preparedness and response policies and capacities are sufficient.<br /><br />Interruptions of congressional operations by incidents such as episodic computer virus infections, or the anthrax contamination that took place during autumn 2001, have demonstrated the importance of congressional continuity of operations (COOP) planning. COOP planning refers to the internal effort of an organization to assure that the capability exists to continue essential functions in response to a comprehensive array of potential operational interruptions. For Congress, COOP planning is related to a second level of preparedness, continuity of government (COG) planning. Congressional COG planning focuses on ensuring that Congress is able to carry out its legislative responsibilities under Article I of the Constitution.<br /><br />Since the 1990s, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has pursued the issues of bribery and tax havens, resulting in changes to certain U.S. laws. In addition, the OECD, under the direction of its member countries, spearheaded an international agreement to outlaw crimes of bribery, and it continues to coordinate efforts aimed at reducing the occurrence of money laundering, corruption, and tax havens.<br /><br />During the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union both deployed thousands of \u201cnonstrategic\u201d nuclear weapons that were intended to be used in support of troops in the field during a conflict. These included nuclear mines; artillery; short, medium, and long-range ballistic missiles; cruise missiles; and gravity bombs. In contrast with the longer-range \u201cstrategic\u201d nuclear weapons, these weapons had a lower profile in policy debates and arms control negotiations. At the end of the 1980s, before the demise of the Soviet Union, each nation still had thousands of these weapons deployed with their troops in the field, aboard naval vessels, and on aircraft. In 1991, both the United States and Soviet Union announced that they would withdraw most and eliminate many of their nonstrategic nuclear weapons.<br /><br />The European Union\u2019s (EU) Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is a cornerstone of the EU\u2019s efforts to meet its obligation under the Kyoto Protocol. It covers more than 10,000 energy intensive facilities across the 27 EU Member countries; covered entities emit about 45% of the EU\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions. A \u201cPhase 1\u201d trading period began January 1, 2005. A second, Phase 2, trading period began in 2008, covering the period of the Kyoto Protocol. A Phase 3 will begin in 2013 designed to reduce emissions by 21% from 2005 levels.<br /><br />Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) is an instantaneous, intense energy field that can overload or disrupt at a distance numerous electrical systems and high technology microcircuits, which are especially sensitive to power surges. A large scale EMP effect can be produced by a single nuclear explosion detonated high in the atmosphere. This method is referred to as High-Altitude EMP (HEMP). A similar, smaller-scale EMP effect can be created using non-nuclear devices with powerful batteries or reactive chemicals. This method is called High Power Microwave (HPM). Several nations, including reported sponsors of terrorism, may currently have a capability to use EMP as a weapon for cyber warfare or cyber terrorism to disrupt communications and other parts of the U.S. critical infrastructure. Also, some equipment and weapons used by the U.S. military may be vulnerable to the effects of EMP.<br /><br />The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) was established in 2004 to ensure that information from any source about potential terrorist acts against the U.S. could be made available to analysts and that appropriate responses could be planned. Investigations of the 9/11 attacks had demonstrated that information possessed by different agencies had not been shared and thus that disparate indications of the looming threat had not been connected and warning had not been provided. As a component of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the NCTC is composed of analysts with backgrounds in many government agencies and has access to various agency databases.<br /><br />Al Qaeda (AQ) has evolved into a significantly different terrorist organization than the one that perpetrated the September 11, 2001, attacks. At the time, Al Qaeda was composed mostly of a core cadre of veterans of the Afghan insurgency against the Soviets, with a centralized leadership structure, made up mostly of Egyptians. Most of the organization\u2019s plots either emanated from the top or were approved by the leadership. Some analysts describe pre-9/11 Al Qaeda as akin to a corporation, with Osama Bin Laden acting as an agile Chief Executive Officer issuing orders and soliciting ideas from subordinates.<br /><br />Shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Congress enacted the USA PATRIOT Act, in part, to \u201cprovid[e] enhanced investigative tools\u201d to \u201cassist in the prevention of future terrorist activities and the preliminary acts and crimes which further such activities.\u201d To that end, the Act eased restrictions on the government\u2019s ability to collect information regarding people\u2019s activities and conversations, both in domestic criminal investigations and in the realms of foreign intelligence gathering and national security.<br /><br />Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign assistance since World War II. From 1976-2004, Israel was the largest annual recipient of U.S. foreign assistance, having been supplanted by Iraq. Since 1985, the United States has provided nearly $3 billion in grants annually to Israel.<br /><br />Page 1 of 21<br /><br />\ufeffSearch for:<br /><br />Follow UsA D V E R T I S E M E N T<br /><br />Categories&bull;", "publish_time": 1569727619179, "collection_time": 1569727619179, "summary": "", "source": "publicintelligence"}

At the tactical level, it assists military planners, commanders, and individual Department of Defense (DOD) components employing military resources and integrating with National Guard Civil Support activities while responding to domestic emergencies in accordance with United States (US) law.<br /><br />Given the complexity and lethality of national security threats in the maritime domain, and in support of the U.S. National Strategy for Maritime Security, and the Sea Services\u2019 (Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard) joint maritime strategy, A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Sea Power, it is vital to America\u2019s interests that the Navy and Coast Guard collaboratively plan, field, and sustain interoperable and affordable forces to provide complementary support for each other\u2019s mission sets. As good stewards of the Nation\u2019s resources and faced with an uncertain budget environment, it is imperative that our services cooperate in a deliberate manner. Implementation of the National Fleet Policy will provide the Nation with more interoperable and fiscally efficient Navy and Coast Guard forces. The National Fleet Plan identifies specific Navy and Coast Guard authorities, methods, and measurements to avoid redundancies and achieve economies of scale. It improves operational effectiveness and provides a mechanism to enhance integration and resource development. The Plan is adaptive to meet emerging national security threats and scalable to address changing service challenges.<br /><br />,A poster depicting various vessels in the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army Navy (PLA(N)) and Maritime Law Enforcement (MLE) that was produced by the Office of Naval Intelligence and is current as of February 2015.<br /><br />NWP 2-01 is a comprehensive reference detailing the intelligence support available to the naval commander in the successful planning and execution of operations. NWP 2-01 is by nature a refresher and ready resource for the Information Dominance Corps (IDC) intelligence professionals, information warfare officers, and cryptologic technicians; however, the target audience is the operational commander. The publication\u2019s length and content are specifically tailored to ensure a practical and valuable reference for the operational decision maker. NWP 2-01 is the foundation for a series of proposed follow-on Navy tactics, techniques, and procedures (NTTP) publications.<br /><br />This navy warfare publication describes the nature, forces, organization, and employment of naval special warfare (NSW). Naval special warfare is a relatively small, maritime special operations force (SOF) consisting of approximately 9,250 personnel: 2,700 sea-air-land commandos (SEALS), 700 special warfare combatant-craft crewmen (SWCCs), 750 Reservists, 4,000 combat support (CS) and combat service support (CSS) personnel, and more than 1,100 civilians. NSW constitutes 11 percent of special operations forces and less than 2 percent of United States Navy (USN) forces. NSW costs 3/10ths of one cent (0.3 percent) of every United States (U.S.) defense dollar.<br /><br />, , ,Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Installation Emergency represents a significant renaming and revision to the November 2007 publication Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Installation CBRN Defense. It expands the scope from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) defense to all-hazards installation emergency management (IEM), including the management of CBRN events. This publication defines the roles of Department of Defense (DOD) installation commanders and staffs and provides the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) associated with installation planning and preparedness for response to, and recovery from, hazards to save lives, protect property, and sustain mission readiness. The purpose of this publication is to summarize existing policies, responsibilities, and procedures for IEM programs at DOD installations worldwide for all hazards, as defined by DODI 6055.17, and to translate this policy into tactical terms applicable to military installation commanders.<br /><br />This Roadmap outlines the Navy\u2019s strategic approach for the Arctic Region and the ways and means to achieve the desired national end state. Resource constraints and competing near-term mission demands require that naval investments be informed, focused, and deliberate. Proactive planning today allows the Navy to prepare its forces for Arctic Region operations. This Roadmap emphasizes low-cost, long-lead activities that position the Navy to meet future demands. In the near to mid-term, the Navy will concentrate on improving operational capabilities, expertise, and capacity, extending reach, and will leverage interagency and international partners to achieve its strategic objectives. The Roadmap recognizes the need to guide investments by prudently balancing regional requirements with national goals.<br /><br />, , ,This publication identifies multi-Service tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) for Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) and Integrating with National Guard Civil Support. It sets forth MTTP at the tactical level to assist the military planner, commander, and individual Service forces in the employment of military resources in response to domestic emergencies in accordance with United States (US) law. This MTTP focuses on planning, preparation, execution, and assessment of DSCA operations conducted within the US and its territories.<br /><br />The Navy is pursuing improved information-based capabilities that will enable it to prevail in the higher-threat, information-intensive combat environments of the 21st Century. This document outlines challenges anticipated over the next 15 years in the operating and information environments, and highlights long-term opportunities for fully integrating Navy\u2019s information-related activities, resources, processes and capabilities to optimize warfighting effects and maintain decision superiority across the spectrum of warfare. The Navy\u2019s plans for achieving Information Dominance center on: 1) assuring command and control (C2) for our deployed forces regardless of the threat environment; 2) enhancing battlespace awareness to shorten the decision cycle inside that of the adversary and to better understand the maritime operating environment; and, 3) fully integrating traditional kinetic and emerging non-kinetic fires to expand warfighting options to both Navy and Joint commanders.<br /><br />Standard operating procedures for Broad Area Maritime Surveillance Demonstrator (BAMS-D) program flights from December 2011.<br /><br />An investigation report concerning the crash of a RQ-4A Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle on June 11, 2012 during a training flight near the Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland.  The report concludes that the accident occurred due to  mechanical malfunction of the right ruddervator actuator.  However, the pilot failed to follow the proper emergency procedures which did not produce disastrous results in this particular event; however, future breaches of established procedures could produce a different outcome.<br /><br />, , ,This publication provides multi-Service tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) to standardize and describe the use of internet tactical chat (TC) in support of operations. Thus, it provides commanders and their units with guidelines to facilitate coordination and integration of TC when conducting multi-Service and joint force operations.<br /><br />, ,Although most terrorist IED attacks outside war zones target civilians or symbols of authority and usually involve a single device, some are designed specifically to target emergency response personnel. The most common tactics involve using secondary or tertiary devices in tiered or sequential attacks intended to kill or maim response personnel after they arrive on the scene of an initial IED incident.<br /><br />A presentation accompanied a recent demonstration of the Cloak Blade, a micro-copter developed by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory under contract from the U.S. Navy.<br /><br />, , ,This publication provides multi-Service TTP for the seamless integration of air assets during the conduct of maritime surface warfare. The maritime domain is defined as the oceans, seas, bays, estuaries, islands, coastal areas, and the airspace above these, including the littorals. AOMSW is intended to support the joint force commander\u2019s (JFC\u2019s) objectives by providing capabilities/forces in support of joint maritime operations. The end state of this publication is a streamlined support process for maritime surface warfare within the joint force maritime component commander\u2019s (JFMCC\u2019s) area of operations (AO).<br /><br />The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Strategic Studies Group (SSG) is chartered with generating revolutionary naval warfighting concepts. SSG XXVIII has been tasked to generate innovative concepts for the operational and tactical employment of unmanned systems, in all domains, as an integral part of the Naval Force for 2020 and beyond. From these innovative concepts, SSG XXVIII is also tasked to produce recommendations and actionable steps for implementation of unmanned systems integration into the Navy\u2019s force structure. This Way Ahead Plan provides a framework for SSG XXVIII\u2019s approach to address this task and challenge. It includes a summary of the SSG\u2019s preliminary thoughts on the value of unmanned systems, an initial overarching concept, and associated concept teams and areas of interest.<br /><br />The focus of NTP-4 Echo (Naval Communications) is to provide a basic manual addressing C4I concepts and capabilities in the U.S. Navy. Due to increased proliferation of Information Technology (IT) within DoN and the high demand for information dominance within the battle space, the need for a \u201cprimary source\u201d C4I document has never been greater. To that end, Naval Network Warfare Command initiated a major revision to this publication reflecting the latest C4I equipment/systems in use today.<br /><br />, , ,JFIRE is a pocket-size, quick-reference guide for requesting fire support in accordance with approved joint tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). JFIRE contains calls for fire, joint air attack team (JAAT) techniques, a format for joint air strike requests, close air support (CAS) coordination and planning procedures, communications architecture, and weapons data.<br /><br />, , ,This multi-Service tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) publication will assist in advising foreign forces. It serves as a reference to ensure coordinated multi-Service operations for planners and operators preparing for, and conducting, advisor team missions. This MTTP is intended to provide units and personnel that are scheduled to advise foreign forces (FF) with viable tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) so that they can successfully plan, train for, and carry out their mission. Currently, material regarding advising is found in joint and Service doctrinal treatment of foreign internal defense (FID), counterinsurgency (COIN), security assistance (SA), and unconventional warfare (UW). Several Services are developing documents that focus on basic survival and common advisor skills, but do not sufficiently cover how an advisor team might function at all levels. This MTTP provides guidance that will help to enhance the activities of some advisor functions and improve inter-Service coordination for this joint mission.<br /><br />This plan outlines the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Strategic Studies Group (SSG) XXVIFs approach to addressing the challenges of operating at the convergence of Sea Power and Cyber Power as presented in the CNOs Theme. In addition to providing a framework for the approach, this plan presents SSG XXVIFs initial overarching concept and Concept Team (CT) areas of focus.<br /><br />This manual provides organizational relationships, responsibilities, requirements and procedures for aircraft and related support operations aboard CVN ships.<br /><br />This document presents information pertinent to the submarine-launched and surface-ship-launched Tomahawk Weapon System (TWS) to include physical and functional descriptions of system components, safety and security considerations, and operations aboard platforms employing the TWS.<br /><br />The intent of the Navy SLL is to inform the Navy total force of Navys foreign language requirements. The list is used to shape foreign language capability and capacity in the force, prioritize development of related training, and facilitate administration of Navy\u2019s Foreign Language Proficiency Bonus (FLPB) Program.<br /><br />A 908 page, Distribution Statement C version of the U.S. Navy NATOPS SH-60B Seahawk Helicopter Flight Manual from April 1, 2008.<br /><br />Law enforcement personnel at all levels serve on the front line of America\u2019s Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). In the interest of national security and public safety, law enforcement investigators frequently must question persons, either for purposes of intelligence gathering, for collecting evidence that may lead to prosecution and take immediate action that may be in the interest of the public safety/force protection. The objective of these interviews/interrogations is to gather accurate and reliable information that furthers security, safety, intelligence, and law enforcement interests. The current threat environment, however, poses some new challenges for professionals conducting terrorism investigations.<br /><br />Page 1 of 31<br /><br />\ufeffSearch for:<br /><br />Follow UsA D V E R T I S E M E N T<br /><br />Categories&bull;", "publish_time": 1569727613441, "collection_time": 1569727613441, "summary": ", , ,This publication identifies multi-Service tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) for Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA).", "source": "publicintelligence"}

Cyber threats are ever-evolving and may come from sophisticated adversaries. Due to common vulnerabilities, instances of security breaches occur across firms and in patterns that are difficult to anticipate. Importantly, cyberattacks and cyber theft impose externalities that may lead to rational underinvestment in cybersecurity by the private sector relative to the socially optimal level of investment. Firms in critical infrastructure sectors may generate especially large negative spillover effects to the wider economy. Insufficient data may impair cybersecurity efforts. Successful protection against cyber threats requires cooperation across firms and between private and public sectors.<br /><br />This document describes the Vulnerabilities Equities Policy and Process for departments and agencies of the United States Government (USG) to balance equities and make determinations regarding disclosure or restriction when the USG obtains knowledge of newly discovered and not publicly known vulnerabilities in information systems and technologies. The primary focus of this policy is to prioritize the publics interest in cybersecurity and to protect core Internet infrastructure, information systems, critical infrastructure systems, and the U.S. economy through the disclosure of vulnerabilities discovered by the USG, absent a demonstrable, overriding interest in the use of the vulnerability for lawful intelligence, law enforcement, or national security purposes.<br /><br />The Joint United States-Canada Electric Grid Security and Resilience Strategy (Strategy) is a collaborative effort between the Federal Governments of the United States and Canada and is intended to strengthen the security and resilience of the U.S. and Canadian electric grid from all adversarial, technological, and natural hazards and threats. The Strategy, released concurrently with this National Electric Grid Security and Resilience Action Plan (Action Plan), details bilateral goals to address the vulnerabilities of the respective and shared electric grid infrastructure of the United States and Canada, not only as an energy security concern, but for reasons of national security. The implementation of the Strategy requires continued action of a nationwide network of governments, departments and agencies (agencies), and private sector partners. This Action Plan details the activities, deliverables, and timelines that will be undertaken primarily by U.S. Federal agencies for the United States to make progress toward the Strategy\u2019s goals.<br /><br />,This Joint United States-Canada Electric Grid Security and Resilience Strategy (Strategy) is a collaborative effort between the Federal Governments of the United States and Canada and is intended to strengthen the security and resilience of the U.S. and Canadian electric grid from all adversarial, technological, and natural hazards and threats. The Strategy addresses the vulnerabilities of the two countries\u2019 respective and shared electric grid infrastructure, not only as an energy security concern, but for reasons of national security. This joint Strategy relies on the existing strong bilateral collaboration between the United States and Canada, and reflects a joint commitment to enhance a shared approach to risk management for the electric grid. It also articulates a common vision of the future electric grid that depends on effective and expanded collaboration among those who own, operate, protect, and rely on the electric grid. Because the electric grid is complex, vital to the functioning of modern society, and dependent on other infrastructure for its function, the United States and Canada developed the Strategy under the shared principle that security and resilience require increasingly collaborative efforts and shared approaches to risk management.<br /><br />AI has applications in many products, such as cars and aircraft, which are subject to regulation designed to protect the public from harm and ensure fairness in economic competition. How will the incorporation of AI into these products affect the relevant regulatory approaches? In general, the approach to regulation of AI-enabled products to protect public safety should be informed by assessment of the aspects of risk that the addition of AI may reduce alongside the aspects of risk that it may increase. If a risk falls within the bounds of an existing regulatory regime, moreover, the policy discussion should start by considering whether the existing regulations already adequately address the risk, or whether they need to be adapted to the addition of AI. Also, where regulatory responses to the addition of AI threaten to increase the cost of compliance, or slow the development or adoption of beneficial innovations, policymakers should consider how those responses could be adjusted to lower costs and barriers to innovation without adversely impacting safety or market fairness.<br /><br />In 2011, the United States adopted the Strategy for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States (Strategy) and a corresponding Strategic Implementation Plan. Since publication, the mission to prevent violent extremism has progressed, and violent extremist threats have continued to evolve. The overall goal of the Strategy and United States Government efforts to implement it remains unchanged: to prevent violent extremists and their supporters from inspiring, radicalizing, financing, or recruiting individuals or groups in the United States to commit acts of violence. This updated Strategic Implementation Plan responds to the current dynamics of violent extremism and reflects experiences and knowledge acquired over the last five years.

Over the last few years, we have successfully streamlined policies and processes, overcome cultural barriers, and better integrated information systems to enable information sharing. Today\u2019s dynamic operating environment, however, challenges us to continue improving information sharing and safeguarding processes and capabilities. While innovation has enhanced our ability to share, increased sharing has created the potential for vulnerabilities requiring strengthened safeguarding practices.

But when individuals or groups choose to further their grievances or ideologies through violence, by engaging in violence themselves or by recruiting and encouraging others to do so, it becomes the collective responsibility of the U.S. Government and the American people to take a stand. In recent history, our country has faced plots by neo-Nazis and other anti-Semitic hate groups, racial supremacists, and international and domestic terrorist groups; and since the September 11 attacks, we have faced an expanded range of plots and attacks in the United States inspired or directed by al-Qa\u2019ida and its affiliates and adherents as well as other violent extremists. Supporters of these groups and their associated ideologies come from different socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnic and religious communities, and areas of the country, making it difficult to predict where violent extremist narratives will resonate.

Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1973. In the intervening weeks and months, coalition efforts have been effective in protecting the Libyan population. The regime has suffered numerous defeats, cities and towns across Libya have been liberated from brutal sieges, strong sanctions are in place, and the regime is encountering serious difficulties raising revenues through oil sales or other means.

Critical life-sustaining infrastructures that deliver electricity and water, control air traffic, and support our financial system all depend on networked information systems. Governments are now able to streamline the provision of essential services through eGovernment initiatives. Social and political movements rely on the Internet to enable new and more expansive forms of organization and action. The reach of networked technology is pervasive and global. For all nations, the underlying digital infrastructure is or will soon become a national asset.<br /><br />A secure cyberspace is critical to our prosperity.

As part of the Strategy, the Administration undertook to review existing laws to ensure that they were effective and to identify deficiencies that could hinder enforcement.

This joint Strategy relies on the existing strong bilateral collaboration between the United States and Canada, and reflects a joint commitment to enhance a shared approach to risk management for the electric grid. It also articulates a common vision of the future electric grid that depends on effective and expanded collaboration among those who own, operate, protect, and rely on the electric grid. Because the electric grid is complex, vital to the functioning of modern society, and dependent on other infrastructure for its function, the United States and Canada developed the Strategy under the shared principle that security and resilience require increasingly collaborative efforts and shared approaches to risk management.<br /><br />AI has applications in many products, such as cars and aircraft, which are subject to regulation designed to protect the public from harm and ensure fairness in economic competition. How will the incorporation of AI into these products affect the relevant regulatory approaches? In general, the approach to regulation of AI-enabled products to protect public safety should be informed by assessment of the aspects of risk that the addition of AI may reduce alongside the aspects of risk that it may increase. If a risk falls within the bounds of an existing regulatory regime, moreover, the policy discussion should start by considering whether the existing regulations already adequately address the risk, or whether they need to be adapted to the addition of AI. Also, where regulatory responses to the addition of AI threaten to increase the cost of compliance, or slow the development or adoption of beneficial innovations, policymakers should consider how those responses could be adjusted to lower costs and barriers to innovation without adversely impacting safety or market fairness.<br /><br />In 2011, the United States adopted the Strategy for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States (Strategy) and a corresponding Strategic Implementation Plan. Since publication, the mission to prevent violent extremism has progressed, and violent extremist threats have continued to evolve. The overall goal of the Strategy and United States Government efforts to implement it remains unchanged: to prevent violent extremists and their supporters from inspiring, radicalizing, financing, or recruiting individuals or groups in the United States to commit acts of violence. This updated Strategic Implementation Plan responds to the current dynamics of violent extremism and reflects experiences and knowledge acquired over the last five years.

The overall goal of the Strategy and United States Government efforts to implement it remains unchanged: to prevent violent extremists and their supporters from inspiring, radicalizing, financing, or recruiting individuals or groups in the United States to commit acts of violence.

It replaces the 2011 Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States.<br /><br />For decades, the federal government has provided billions of dollars in equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies (LEAs) through excess equipment transfers, asset forfeiture programs and federal grants. Particularly in the years since September 11, 2001, Congress and the Executive Branch have steadily increased spending and support for these programs, in light of legitimate concerns about the growing threat of terrorism, shrinking local budgets, and the relative ease with which some criminals are able to obtain high-powered weapons. These programs have significantly expanded over decades across multiple federal agencies without, at times, a commensurate growth in the infrastructure required to standardize procedures governing the flow of equipment from the federal government to LEAs. At the same time, training has not been institutionalized, specifically with respect to civil rights and civil liberties protections, or the safe use of equipment received through the federal government. Concerns over the lack of consistent protections have received renewed focus and attention in light of the recent unrest in Ferguson, Missouri.<br /><br />Two reports released by the Executive Office of the President and the Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology on big data and privacy in May 2014.<br /><br />Section 215 is designed to enable the FBI to acquire records that a business has in its possession, as part of an FBI investigation, when those records are relevant to the investigation. Yet the operation of the NSA\u2019s bulk telephone records program bears almost no resemblance to that description. While the Board believes that this program has been conducted in good faith to vigorously pursue the government\u2019s counterterrorism mission and appreciates the government\u2019s efforts to bring the program under the oversight of the FISA court, the Board concludes that Section 215 does not provide an adequate legal basis to support the program. There are four grounds upon which we find that the telephone records program fails to comply with Section 215. First, the telephone records acquired under the program have no connection to any specific FBI investigation at the time of their collection. Second, because the records are collected in bulk \u2014 potentially encompassing all telephone calling records across the nation \u2014 they cannot be regarded as \u201crelevant\u201d to any FBI investigation as required by the statute without redefining the word relevant in a manner that is circular, unlimited in scope, and out of step with the case law from analogous legal contexts involving the production of records. Third, the program operates by putting telephone companies under an obligation to furnish new calling records on a daily basis as they are generated (instead of turning over records already in their possession) \u2014 an approach lacking foundation in the statute and one that is inconsistent with FISA as a whole. Fourth, the statute permits only the FBI to obtain items for use in its investigations; it does not authorize the NSA to collect anything.<br /><br />A report produced by the National Security Council Study Group headed by Paul Nitze in 1950.

This information sharing mandate requires sustained and responsible collaboration between Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and foreign partners. Over the last few years, we have successfully streamlined policies and processes, overcome cultural barriers, and better integrated information systems to enable information sharing. Today\u2019s dynamic operating environment, however, challenges us to continue improving information sharing and safeguarding processes and capabilities. While innovation has enhanced our ability to share, increased sharing has created the potential for vulnerabilities requiring strengthened safeguarding practices.

In our efforts to counter violent extremism, we will rely on existing partnerships that communities have forged with Federal, State, and local government agencies.

But when individuals or groups choose to further their grievances or ideologies through violence, by engaging in violence themselves or by recruiting and encouraging others to do so, it becomes the collective responsibility of the U.S. Government and the American people to take a stand. In recent history, our country has faced plots by neo-Nazis and other anti-Semitic hate groups, racial supremacists, and international and domestic terrorist groups; and since the September 11 attacks, we have faced an expanded range of plots and attacks in the United States inspired or directed by al-Qa\u2019ida and its affiliates and adherents as well as other violent extremists. Supporters of these groups and their associated ideologies come from different socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnic and religious communities, and areas of the country, making it difficult to predict where violent extremist narratives will resonate. And as history has shown, the prevalence of particular violent extremist ideologies changes over time, and new threats will undoubtedly arise in the future.<br /><br />Transnational organized crime refers to those self-perpetuating associations of individuals who operate transnationally for the purpose of obtaining power, influence, monetary and/or commercial gains, wholly or in part by illegal means, while protecting their activities through a pattern of corruption and/or violence, or while protecting their illegal activities through a transnational organizational structure and the exploitation of transnational commerce or communication mechanisms. There is no single structure under which transnational organized criminals operate; they vary from hierarchies to clans, networks, and cells, and may evolve to other structures.<br /><br />In his address to the nation on Libya on March 28, 2011, President Obama presented a comprehensive explanation for why he authorized military action as part of an international coalition to protect the people of Libya and to enforce U.N. Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1973. In the intervening weeks and months, coalition efforts have been effective in protecting the Libyan population. The regime has suffered numerous defeats, cities and towns across Libya have been liberated from brutal sieges, strong sanctions are in place, and the regime is encountering serious difficulties raising revenues through oil sales or other means. All these actions and outcomes are consistent with UNSCR 1973.<br /><br />Digital infrastructure is increasingly the backbone of prosperous economies, vigorous research communities, strong militaries, transparent governments, and free  societies. As never before, information technology is fostering transnational dialogue and facilitating the global flow of goods and services. These social and trade links have become indispensable to our daily lives. Critical life-sustaining infrastructures that deliver electricity and water, control air traffic, and support our financial system all depend on networked information systems. Governments are now able to streamline the provision of essential services through eGovernment initiatives. Social and political movements rely on the Internet to enable new and more expansive forms of organization and action. The reach of networked technology is pervasive and global. For all nations, the underlying digital infrastructure is or will soon become a national asset.<br /><br />A secure cyberspace is critical to our prosperity.

As part of the Strategy, the Administration undertook to review existing laws to ensure that they were effective and to identify deficiencies that could hinder enforcement.

This joint Strategy relies on the existing strong bilateral collaboration between the United States and Canada, and reflects a joint commitment to enhance a shared approach to risk management for the electric grid. It also articulates a common vision of the future electric grid that depends on effective and expanded collaboration among those who own, operate, protect, and rely on the electric grid. Because the electric grid is complex, vital to the functioning of modern society, and dependent on other infrastructure for its function, the United States and Canada developed the Strategy under the shared principle that security and resilience require increasingly collaborative efforts and shared approaches to risk management.<br /><br />AI has applications in many products, such as cars and aircraft, which are subject to regulation designed to protect the public from harm and ensure fairness in economic competition. How will the incorporation of AI into these products affect the relevant regulatory approaches? In general, the approach to regulation of AI-enabled products to protect public safety should be informed by assessment of the aspects of risk that the addition of AI may reduce alongside the aspects of risk that it may increase. If a risk falls within the bounds of an existing regulatory regime, moreover, the policy discussion should start by considering whether the existing regulations already adequately address the risk, or whether they need to be adapted to the addition of AI. Also, where regulatory responses to the addition of AI threaten to increase the cost of compliance, or slow the development or adoption of beneficial innovations, policymakers should consider how those responses could be adjusted to lower costs and barriers to innovation without adversely impacting safety or market fairness.<br /><br />In 2011, the United States adopted the Strategy for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States (Strategy) and a corresponding Strategic Implementation Plan.

In general, the approach to regulation of AI-enabled products to protect public safety should be informed by assessment of the aspects of risk that the addition of AI may reduce alongside the aspects of risk that it may increase. If a risk falls within the bounds of an existing regulatory regime, moreover, the policy discussion should start by considering whether the existing regulations already adequately address the risk, or whether they need to be adapted to the addition of AI. Also, where regulatory responses to the addition of AI threaten to increase the cost of compliance, or slow the development or adoption of beneficial innovations, policymakers should consider how those responses could be adjusted to lower costs and barriers to innovation without adversely impacting safety or market fairness.<br /><br />In 2011, the United States adopted the Strategy for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States (Strategy) and a corresponding Strategic Implementation Plan. Since publication, the mission to prevent violent extremism has progressed, and violent extremist threats have continued to evolve. The overall goal of the Strategy and United States Government efforts to implement it remains unchanged: to prevent violent extremists and their supporters from inspiring, radicalizing, financing, or recruiting individuals or groups in the United States to commit acts of violence. This updated Strategic Implementation Plan responds to the current dynamics of violent extremism and reflects experiences and knowledge acquired over the last five years. It replaces the 2011 Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States.<br /><br />For decades, the federal government has provided billions of dollars in equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies (LEAs) through excess equipment transfers, asset forfeiture programs and federal grants. Particularly in the years since September 11, 2001, Congress and the Executive Branch have steadily increased spending and support for these programs, in light of legitimate concerns about the growing threat of terrorism, shrinking local budgets, and the relative ease with which some criminals are able to obtain high-powered weapons. These programs have significantly expanded over decades across multiple federal agencies without, at times, a commensurate growth in the infrastructure required to standardize procedures governing the flow of equipment from the federal government to LEAs. At the same time, training has not been institutionalized, specifically with respect to civil rights and civil liberties protections, or the safe use of equipment received through the federal government. Concerns over the lack of consistent protections have received renewed focus and attention in light of the recent unrest in Ferguson, Missouri.<br /><br />Two reports released by the Executive Office of the President and the Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology on big data and privacy in May 2014.<br /><br />Section 215 is designed to enable the FBI to acquire records that a business has in its possession, as part of an FBI investigation, when those records are relevant to the investigation. Yet the operation of the NSA\u2019s bulk telephone records program bears almost no resemblance to that description. While the Board believes that this program has been conducted in good faith to vigorously pursue the government\u2019s counterterrorism mission and appreciates the government\u2019s efforts to bring the program under the oversight of the FISA court, the Board concludes that Section 215 does not provide an adequate legal basis to support the program. There are four grounds upon which we find that the telephone records program fails to comply with Section 215. First, the telephone records acquired under the program have no connection to any specific FBI investigation at the time of their collection. Second, because the records are collected in bulk \u2014 potentially encompassing all telephone calling records across the nation \u2014 they cannot be regarded as \u201crelevant\u201d to any FBI investigation as required by the statute without redefining the word relevant in a manner that is circular, unlimited in scope, and out of step with the case law from analogous legal contexts involving the production of records. Third, the program operates by putting telephone companies under an obligation to furnish new calling records on a daily basis as they are generated (instead of turning over records already in their possession) \u2014 an approach lacking foundation in the statute and one that is inconsistent with FISA as a whole. Fourth, the statute permits only the FBI to obtain items for use in its investigations; it does not authorize the NSA to collect anything.<br /><br />A report produced by the National Security Council Study Group headed by Paul Nitze in 1950.  NSC-68 is considered to be one of the most significant documents in the history of the U.S. national security apparatus, defining goals, values, and functions of U.S. national security policy throughout the Cold War and beyond.  Historian Michael J. Hogan, scholar of U.S. foreign policy and former fellow at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library, has described the document as the bible of American national security policy.<br /><br />,The Hemisphere Project is coordinated from the Los Angeles Clearinghouse and is funded by ONDCP and DEA. Hemisphere provides electronic call detail records (CDRs) in response to federal, state, and local administrative/grand jury subpoenas. The Hemisphere database contains CDRs for any telephone carrier that uses an AT&#038;T switch to process a telephone call. Hemisphere is an unclassified program. Hemisphere provides de-confliction within the Hemisphere database. 4 billion CDRs populate the Hemisphere database on a daily basis.<br /><br />The Administration is focused on protecting the innovation that drives the American economy and supports jobs in the United States. As a Nation, we create products and services that improve the world\u2019s ability to communicate, to learn, to understand diverse cultures and beliefs, to be mobile, to live better and longer lives, to produce and consume energy efficiently and to secure food, nourishment and safety. Most of the value of this work is intangible\u2014it lies in America\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit, our creativity, ingenuity and insistence on progress and in creating a better life for our communities and for communities around the world. These intangible assets are often captured as intellectual property\u2014copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets, and reflect America\u2019s advantage in the global economy.<br /><br />Our national security depends on our ability to share the right information, with the right people, at the right time. This information sharing mandate requires sustained and responsible collaboration between Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and foreign partners. Over the last few years, we have successfully streamlined policies and processes, overcome cultural barriers, and better integrated information systems to enable information sharing. Today\u2019s dynamic operating environment, however, challenges us to continue improving information sharing and safeguarding processes and capabilities. While innovation has enhanced our ability to share, increased sharing has created the potential for vulnerabilities requiring strengthened safeguarding practices. The 2012 National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding provides guidance for effective development, integration, and implementation of policies, processes, standards, and technologies to promote secure and responsible information sharing.<br /><br />Law enforcement and government officials for decades have understood the critical importance of building relationships, based on trust, with the communities they serve. Partnerships are vital to address a range of challenges and must have as their foundation a genuine commitment on the part of law enforcement and government to address community needs and concerns, including protecting rights and public safety. In our efforts to counter violent extremism, we will rely on existing partnerships that communities have forged with Federal, State, and local government agencies. This reliance, however, must not change the nature or purpose of existing relationships. In many instances, our partnerships and related activities were not created for national security purposes but nonetheless have an indirect impact on countering violent extremism (CVE).<br /><br />This order directs structural reforms to ensure responsible sharing and safeguarding of classified information on computer networks that shall be consistent with appropriate protections for privacy and civil liberties. Agencies bear the primary responsibility for meeting these twin goals. These structural reforms will ensure coordinated interagency development and reliable implementation of policies and minimum standards regarding information security, personnel security, and systems security; address both internal and external security threats and vulnerabilities; and provide policies and minimum standards for sharing classified information both within and outside the Federal Government. These policies and minimum standards will address all agencies that operate or access classified computer networks, all users of classified computer networks (including contractors and others who operate or access classified computer networks controlled by the Federal Government), and all classified information on those networks.<br /><br />,Emails and documents related to the ongoing investigation of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives  Fast and Furious/Project Gun Runner program leaked to CBS.  Includes a map of distribution routes for weapons involved in the program leading to locations throughout Mexico.<br /><br />Presidential Policy Directive 2 is one of a number that have not previously been released. It was publicly posted to a collaboration server for U.S. military personnel complete with its National Security Council coversheet intact, providing a rare look at dissemination guidelines utilized in high-level documentation.<br /><br />Throughout history, violent extremists\u2014individuals who support or commit ideologically-motivated violence to further political goals\u2014have promoted messages of divisiveness and justified the killing of innocents. The United States Constitution recognizes freedom of expression, even for individuals who espouse unpopular or even hateful views. But when individuals or groups choose to further their grievances or ideologies through violence, by engaging in violence themselves or by recruiting and encouraging others to do so, it becomes the collective responsibility of the U.S. Government and the American people to take a stand. In recent history, our country has faced plots by neo-Nazis and other anti-Semitic hate groups, racial supremacists, and international and domestic terrorist groups; and since the September 11 attacks, we have faced an expanded range of plots and attacks in the United States inspired or directed by al-Qa\u2019ida and its affiliates and adherents as well as other violent extremists. Supporters of these groups and their associated ideologies come from different socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnic and religious communities, and areas of the country, making it difficult to predict where violent extremist narratives will resonate. And as history has shown, the prevalence of particular violent extremist ideologies changes over time, and new threats will undoubtedly arise in the future.<br /><br />Transnational organized crime refers to those self-perpetuating associations of individuals who operate transnationally for the purpose of obtaining power, influence, monetary and/or commercial gains, wholly or in part by illegal means, while protecting their activities through a pattern of corruption and/or violence, or while protecting their illegal activities through a transnational organizational structure and the exploitation of transnational commerce or communication mechanisms. There is no single structure under which transnational organized criminals operate; they vary from hierarchies to clans, networks, and cells, and may evolve to other structures.<br /><br />In his address to the nation on Libya on March 28, 2011, President Obama presented a comprehensive explanation for why he authorized military action as part of an international coalition to protect the people of Libya and to enforce U.N. Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1973. In the intervening weeks and months, coalition efforts have been effective in protecting the Libyan population. The regime has suffered numerous defeats, cities and towns across Libya have been liberated from brutal sieges, strong sanctions are in place, and the regime is encountering serious difficulties raising revenues through oil sales or other means. All these actions and outcomes are consistent with UNSCR 1973.<br /><br />Digital infrastructure is increasingly the backbone of prosperous economies, vigorous research communities, strong militaries, transparent governments, and free  societies. As never before, information technology is fostering transnational dialogue and facilitating the global flow of goods and services. These social and trade links have become indispensable to our daily lives. Critical life-sustaining infrastructures that deliver electricity and water, control air traffic, and support our financial system all depend on networked information systems. Governments are now able to streamline the provision of essential services through eGovernment initiatives. Social and political movements rely on the Internet to enable new and more expansive forms of organization and action. The reach of networked technology is pervasive and global. For all nations, the underlying digital infrastructure is or will soon become a national asset.<br /><br />A secure cyberspace is critical to our prosperity. We use the Internet and other online environments to increase our productivity, as a platform for innovation, and as a venue in which to create new businesses. \u201cOur digital infrastructure, therefore, is a strategic national asset, and protecting it\u2014while safeguarding privacy and civil liberties\u2014is a national security priority\u201d and an economic necessity.  By addressing threats in this environment, we will help individuals protect themselves in cyberspace and enable both the private sector and government to offer more services online. As a Nation, we are addressing many of the technical and policy shortcomings that have led to insecurity in cyberspace Among these shortcomings is the online authentication of people and devices: the President\u2019s Cyberspace Policy Review established trusted identities as a cornerstone of improved cybersecurity.<br /><br />,A copy of Barack Obamas long-form birth certificate released April 27, 2011 by the White House.<br /><br />On June 22, 2010, the U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (IPEC) issued the Administration\u2019s first Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property Enforcement (Strategy), which was developed in coordination with many Federal agencies, including the Departments of Commerce, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), and State, and the U.S. Trade Representative. As part of the Strategy, the Administration undertook to review existing laws to ensure that they were effective and to identify deficiencies that could hinder enforcement. Based on that review, this White Paper identifies specific recommended legislative changes, designed to increase the effectiveness of U.S. enforcement efforts. We will, of course, continue to assess existing legislation and recommend any further changes to the law as the need arises.<br /><br />Our national defense requires that sensitive information be maintained in confidence to protect our citizens, our democratic institutions, and our homeland. Protecting information critical to our nation\u2019s security is the responsibility of each individual who is granted access to classified information. Any unauthorized disclosure of classified information is a violation of our law and compromises our national security. The recent irresponsible disclosure by WikiLeaks has resulted in significant damage to our national security. Any failure by agencies to safeguard classified information pursuant to relevant laws, including but not limited to Executive Order 13526, Classified National Security Information (December 29, 2009), is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.<br /><br />Page 1 of 21<br /><br />\ufeffSearch for:<br /><br />Follow UsA D V E R T I S E M E N T<br /><br />Categories&bull;", "publish_time": 1569727602473, "collection_time": 1569727602473, "summary": "", "source": "publicintelligence"}

The video addresses the group\u2019s territorial defeat in Syria, discusses the acceptance of pledges of allegiance from ISIS supporters, and praises recent attacks in Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia. This JIB is provided by the FBI, DHS, and NCTC to support their respective activities and to assist federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government counterterrorism and law enforcement officials and private sector security partners in deterring, preventing, or disrupting terrorist attacks against the United States. All video details described in this JIB are taken from the translated transcript of Baghdadi\u2019s speech.<br /><br />We assess that a Shia homegrown violent extremist (HVE) attack in the US is highly unlikely absent a catalyzing event that could galvanize some US-based Shia to engage independently in violence. Given sustained bilateral US-Iran tensions, the occurrence of such a catalyst could prompt Shia HVE activity relatively quickly, underscoring the benefits of early engagement with Shia communities about indicators of HVE radicalization. Potential triggering events for such Shia HVE violence include US military action against Iran and Lebanese Hizballah, Shia leadership or senior clerics sanctioning violence in the US, prominent Sunni government attacks on Shia, or high-profile anti-Shia activity in the US, judging from the results of a structured NCTC brainstorming exercise.<br /><br />NCTC assesses that the Sunni extremist threat to the US before 9/11 was characterized by diverse extremist organizations and lone actors motivated by multiple ideological narratives and other factors, including Salafi jihadism, Palestinian nationalism, theological disputes within Islam, anti-Semitism, and anti-Hindu sentiments. We have identified a dozen successful attacks, four disrupted plots, and one attempt to set up an extremist training camp in the US between 1973 and 2001, underscoring the persistent threat from al-Qa\u2018ida\u2013associated extremists, Palestinian terrorist groups, and Sunni extremist lone actors in the decades leading up to 9/11. These extremists chose a wide array of targets, with the majority of their attacks before 1993 focused on Hindu, Jewish, or Muslim individuals or institutions. Most attacks after that date were against civilian or US Government targets, because of al-Qa\u2018ida\u2013associated extremists\u2019 focus on indiscriminate mass casualty attacks. In some cases, we lack clear insight into the attackers\u2019 motivations because of information gaps, and FBI disagrees about the motivations underlying two of these attacks.<br /><br />, ,This Joint Intelligence Bulletin (JIB) is intended to provide information on Australian national and violent extremist Brenton Tarrant\u2019s 15 March 2019 attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. These attacks underscore the enduring nature of violent threats posed to faith-based communities. FBI, DHS, and NCTC advise federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government counterterrorism and law enforcement officials and private sector security partners responsible for securing faith-based communities in the Homeland to remain vigilant in light of the enduring threat to faith-based communities posed by domestic extremists (DEs), as well as by homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) who may seek retaliation.<br /><br />Counterterrorism Weekly is an UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY compilation of open source publicly available press and relevant commentary on issues related to terrorism and counterterrorism over the past seven days. It is produced every Wednesday, excluding holidays. Counterterrorism Weekly is produced by the National Counterterrorism Center and contains situational awareness items detailing ongoing terrorism-related developments which may be of interest to Federal, State, Local and Tribal Law Enforcement, security, military personnel, and first responders. Information contained in the Counterterrorism Weekly is subject to change as a situation further develops.<br /><br />This reference aid draws on CTIIC\u2019s experience promoting interagency situational awareness and information sharing during previous significant cyber events\u2014including cyber threats to elections. It provides a guide to cyber threat terms and related terminology issues likely to arise when describing cyber activity. The document includes a range of cyber-specific terms that may be required to accurately convey intelligence on a cyber threat event and terms that have been established by relevant authorities regarding technical infrastructure for conducting elections.<br /><br />A presentation from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on the Common Cyber Threat Framework from July 2018.<br /><br />In the 2011 report to Congress on Foreign Spies Stealing U.S. Economic Secrets in Cyberspace, the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive provided a baseline assessment of the many dangers facing the U.S. research, development, and manufacturing sectors when operating in cyberspace, the pervasive threats posed by foreign intelligence services and other threat actors, and the industries and technologies most likely at risk of espionage. The 2018 report provides additional insight into the most pervasive nation-state threats, and it includes a detailed breakout of the industrial sectors and technologies judged to be of highest interest to threat actors. It also discusses several potentially disruptive threat trends that warrant close attention.<br /><br />, ,The late 2016 arrest of two California teenagers for allegedly planning a \u201cmass casualty event\u201d by carrying out a chemical attack at a local high school pep rally highlights how individuals can use online resources to plan crude chemical or biological attacks. Violent extremists continue to circulate often ineffective or misleading how-to instructions for producing and disseminating poisons, crude biological toxins, and toxic industrial chemicals that in many cases are commercially available and easy to obtain. While we have no indication the suspects in this case subscribed to or consumed material related to violent extremist ideologies, their activity highlights one path to conducting a potential chemical or biological attack.<br /><br />, ,There is continued terrorist interest in attacking the rail system either as the primary target or as an attack mechanism. The US railroad system includes 800 railroads, 144,000 miles of track, and 212,000 railroad crossings. First responders should work closely with railroad police departments and other security partners to better protect rail assets\u2014including freight rail (railcars loaded with commodities or hazardous materials), passenger rail (Amtrak, regional, or commuter rail), heavy rail (metro, and subway), and light rail (street cars, tramways, or trolleys)\u2014from terrorist attacks and criminal activities. This product was developed to provide general rail safety tips and resources to help increase first responder awareness of the rail environment.<br /><br />, ,Food and agriculture infrastructure is a $1 trillion industry, almost entirely under private ownership and comprises an estimated 2.1 million farms, 935,000 restaurants, and more than 200,000 registered food manufacturing, processing, and storage facilities. Intentional contamination of the food supply could have significant public health and economic consequences depending on the commodity, the agent used, and where in the supply chain the contaminant was added. This product provides first responders and private-sector stakeholders an awareness of the complex operating environment that may result from intentional contamination of the food supply and identifies key collaborative partners and indicators to minimize the risk of an intentional attack on the food supply.<br /><br />NCTC assesses that the Sunni violent extremist threat in the US has evolved from one defined by complex, large-scale attacks directed by a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) to mostly self-initiated attacks by homegrown violent extremists using relatively simple methods. Of the 28 Sunni violent extremist attacks in the US since 9/11 only three were directed by an FTO. Most attacks were perpetrated by individuals enabled\u2014through encouragement or operational support\u2014or inspired by ISIS, al-Qa\u2018ida, and al-Qa\u2018ida affiliates.<br /><br />, ,The number of criminal and gang-related assaults involving acid or other corrosive substances has risen sharply in some Western countries. As of July 2017, police statistics in England indicate assaults and threats involving corrosives have risen from 183 in 2012 to more than 500 this year, according to open source reporting. Although there has been minimal specific interest by terrorists in acid attacks to date, we judge the increase in criminal incidents coupled with recent English-language terrorist messaging encouraging attacks using acid may spur opportunistic terrorist use of the tactic, underscoring the potential threat and importance of an immediate on-scene emergency response.<br /><br />In August, ISIS released a seven-minute, English-language video encouraging would-be fighters to travel to the Philippines instead of Syria and Iraq. The video was the latest sign the group has shifted its recruiting tactics as it loses ground to Coalition Forces in the Middle East. Asia has become a new focus for ISIS, according to private sector analysts, such as Flashpoint Intelligence.<br /><br />, ,This case study is an examination of behaviors that resulted in a disrupted terrorist attack, revealing a cycle of planning and preparation that could provide indicators for preventing similar attempts. The terrorist attack planning cycle is not a static, linear process but rather could begin in any of the several stages with variances in details, sequence, and timing. An individual\u2019s mobilization to violence often provides observable behavioral indicators such as, pre-attack surveillance, training, and rehearsal. The indicators potentially allow third-party observers and law enforcement to identify individuals moving to violence, circumstances that may allow for disruption of planned attacks. This product is intended to cultivate an awareness of the planning cycle among stakeholders for identification, mitigation, and disruption of attack planning.<br /><br />, ,The Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) is attempting to obtain money from organ harvesting, including from its own injured members, captives, and deceased individuals. Identification, prevention, and interdiction of organ harvesting and trafficking is a highly complex issue which may be effectively addressed through international partnerships among governmental, health, law enforcement, legal, and private-sector entities.<br /><br />, ,We assess with moderate confidence that cyber actors, including those who support violent extremism, are likely to continue targeting first responders on the World Wide Web, including by distributing personally identifiable information (PII) for the purpose of soliciting attacks from willing sympathizers in the homeland, hacking government websites, or attacking 911 phone systems to hinder first responders\u2019 ability to respond to crises.<br /><br />The National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) is charged with leading and supporting the counterintelligence (CI) and security activities of the U.S. government, the U.S. Intelligence Community, and U.S. private sector entities that are at risk of intelligence collection, penetration, or attack by foreign adversaries and malicious insiders. The capabilities and activities described in this Guide are exemplars of program components delineated as requirements in numerous strategies, policies, and guidelines.<br /><br />The indicators of violent extremist mobilization described herein are intended to provide federal, state, local, territorial and tribal law enforcement a roadmap of observable behaviors that could inform whether individuals or groups are preparing to engage in violent extremist activities including potential travel overseas to join a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). The indicators are grouped by their assessed levels of diagnosticity\u2014meaning how clearly we judge the behavior demonstrates an individual\u2019s trajectory towards terrorist activity.<br /><br />, ,Recent calls over the past year for attacks on hospitals in the West by media outlets sympathetic to the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) highlight terrorists\u2019 perception of hospitals as viable targets for attack. Targeting hospitals and healthcare facilities is consistent with ISIS\u2019s tactics in Iraq and Syria, its previous calls for attacks on hospitals in the West, and the group\u2019s calls for attacks in the West using \u201call available means.\u201d While we have not seen any specific, credible threat against hospitals and healthcare facilities in the United States, we remain concerned that calls for such attacks may resonate with some violent extremists and lone offenders in the Homeland because of their likely perceived vulnerabilities and value as targets.<br /><br />We are living a paradox: The achievements of the industrial and information ages are shaping a world to come that is both more dangerous and richer with opportunity than ever before. Whether promise or peril prevails will turn on the choices of humankind. The progress of the past decades is historic\u2014connecting people, empowering individuals, groups, and states, and lifting a billion people out of poverty in the process. But this same progress also spawned shocks like the Arab Spring, the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, and the global rise of populist, anti-establishment politics. These shocks reveal how fragile the achievements have been, underscoring deep shifts in the global landscape that portend a dark and difficult near future.<br /><br />,The nature of cyberspace makes attribution of cyber operations difficult but not impossible. Every kind of cyber operation\u2014malicious or not\u2014leaves a trail. US Intelligence Community analysts use this information, their constantly growing knowledge base of previous events and known malicious actors, and their knowledge of how these malicious actors work and the tools that they use, to attempt to trace these operations back to their source. In every case, they apply the same tradecraft standards described in the Analytic Process above.<br /><br />, ,This Joint Intelligence Bulletin (JIB) is intended to provide new insight into the targeting preferences of some homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) and to examine detection challenges and opportunities. This JIB is provided by FBI, DHS, and NCTC to support their respective activities and to assist federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government counterterrorism and law enforcement officials and private sector security partners in deterring, preventing, or disrupting terrorist attacks within the United States.<br /><br />In accordance with the President\u2019s direction and consistent with the President\u2019s commitment to providing as much information as possible to the American people about U.S. counterterrorism activities, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) is releasing today a summary of information provided to the DNI about both the number of strikes taken by the U.S. Government against terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities and the assessed number of combatant and non-combatant deaths resulting from those strikes. \u201cAreas of active hostilities\u201d currently include Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria.<br /><br />Examples of the National Counterterrorism Centers Counterterrorism Weekly for Americas Protectors from April 2016, a compilation of open source publicly available press and relevant commentary on issues related to terrorism and counterterrorism over the past seven days.<br /><br />Page 1 of 61<br /><br />&hellip;\ufeffSearch for:<br /><br />Follow UsA D V E R T I S E M E N T<br /><br />Categories&bull;", "publish_time": 1569727589895, "collection_time": 1569727589895, "summary": "", "source": "publicintelligence"}

While we have no indication the suspects in this case subscribed to or consumed material related to violent extremist ideologies, their activity highlights one path to conducting a potential chemical or biological attack.<br /><br />, ,There is continued terrorist interest in attacking the rail system either as the primary target or as an attack mechanism. The US railroad system includes 800 railroads, 144,000 miles of track, and 212,000 railroad crossings. First responders should work closely with railroad police departments and other security partners to better protect rail assets\u2014including freight rail (railcars loaded with commodities or hazardous materials), passenger rail (Amtrak, regional, or commuter rail), heavy rail (metro, and subway), and light rail (street cars, tramways, or trolleys)\u2014from terrorist attacks and criminal activities. This product was developed to provide general rail safety tips and resources to help increase first responder awareness of the rail environment.<br /><br />, ,Food and agriculture infrastructure is a $1 trillion industry, almost entirely under private ownership and comprises an estimated 2.1 million farms, 935,000 restaurants, and more than 200,000 registered food manufacturing, processing, and storage facilities. Intentional contamination of the food supply could have significant public health and economic consequences depending on the commodity, the agent used, and where in the supply chain the contaminant was added. This product provides first responders and private-sector stakeholders an awareness of the complex operating environment that may result from intentional contamination of the food supply and identifies key collaborative partners and indicators to minimize the risk of an intentional attack on the food supply.<br /><br />NCTC assesses that the Sunni violent extremist threat in the US has evolved from one defined by complex, large-scale attacks directed by a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) to mostly self-initiated attacks by homegrown violent extremists using relatively simple methods. Of the 28 Sunni violent extremist attacks in the US since 9/11 only three were directed by an FTO. Most attacks were perpetrated by individuals enabled\u2014through encouragement or operational support\u2014or inspired by ISIS, al-Qa\u2018ida, and al-Qa\u2018ida affiliates.<br /><br />, ,The number of criminal and gang-related assaults involving acid or other corrosive substances has risen sharply in some Western countries. As of July 2017, police statistics in England indicate assaults and threats involving corrosives have risen from 183 in 2012 to more than 500 this year, according to open source reporting. Although there has been minimal specific interest by terrorists in acid attacks to date, we judge the increase in criminal incidents coupled with recent English-language terrorist messaging encouraging attacks using acid may spur opportunistic terrorist use of the tactic, underscoring the potential threat and importance of an immediate on-scene emergency response.<br /><br />In August, ISIS released a seven-minute, English-language video encouraging would-be fighters to travel to the Philippines instead of Syria and Iraq. The video was the latest sign the group has shifted its recruiting tactics as it loses ground to Coalition Forces in the Middle East. Asia has become a new focus for ISIS, according to private sector analysts, such as Flashpoint Intelligence.<br /><br />, ,This case study is an examination of behaviors that resulted in a disrupted terrorist attack, revealing a cycle of planning and preparation that could provide indicators for preventing similar attempts. The terrorist attack planning cycle is not a static, linear process but rather could begin in any of the several stages with variances in details, sequence, and timing. An individual\u2019s mobilization to violence often provides observable behavioral indicators such as, pre-attack surveillance, training, and rehearsal. The indicators potentially allow third-party observers and law enforcement to identify individuals moving to violence, circumstances that may allow for disruption of planned attacks. This product is intended to cultivate an awareness of the planning cycle among stakeholders for identification, mitigation, and disruption of attack planning.<br /><br />, ,The Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) is attempting to obtain money from organ harvesting, including from its own injured members, captives, and deceased individuals. Identification, prevention, and interdiction of organ harvesting and trafficking is a highly complex issue which may be effectively addressed through international partnerships among governmental, health, law enforcement, legal, and private-sector entities.<br /><br />, ,We assess with moderate confidence that cyber actors, including those who support violent extremism, are likely to continue targeting first responders on the World Wide Web, including by distributing personally identifiable information (PII) for the purpose of soliciting attacks from willing sympathizers in the homeland, hacking government websites, or attacking 911 phone systems to hinder first responders\u2019 ability to respond to crises.<br /><br />The National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) is charged with leading and supporting the counterintelligence (CI) and security activities of the U.S. government, the U.S. Intelligence Community, and U.S. private sector entities that are at risk of intelligence collection, penetration, or attack by foreign adversaries and malicious insiders. The capabilities and activities described in this Guide are exemplars of program components delineated as requirements in numerous strategies, policies, and guidelines.<br /><br />The indicators of violent extremist mobilization described herein are intended to provide federal, state, local, territorial and tribal law enforcement a roadmap of observable behaviors that could inform whether individuals or groups are preparing to engage in violent extremist activities including potential travel overseas to join a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). The indicators are grouped by their assessed levels of diagnosticity\u2014meaning how clearly we judge the behavior demonstrates an individual\u2019s trajectory towards terrorist activity.<br /><br />, ,Recent calls over the past year for attacks on hospitals in the West by media outlets sympathetic to the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) highlight terrorists\u2019 perception of hospitals as viable targets for attack. Targeting hospitals and healthcare facilities is consistent with ISIS\u2019s tactics in Iraq and Syria, its previous calls for attacks on hospitals in the West, and the group\u2019s calls for attacks in the West using \u201call available means.\u201d While we have not seen any specific, credible threat against hospitals and healthcare facilities in the United States, we remain concerned that calls for such attacks may resonate with some violent extremists and lone offenders in the Homeland because of their likely perceived vulnerabilities and value as targets.<br /><br />We are living a paradox: The achievements of the industrial and information ages are shaping a world to come that is both more dangerous and richer with opportunity than ever before. Whether promise or peril prevails will turn on the choices of humankind. The progress of the past decades is historic\u2014connecting people, empowering individuals, groups, and states, and lifting a billion people out of poverty in the process. But this same progress also spawned shocks like the Arab Spring, the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, and the global rise of populist, anti-establishment politics. These shocks reveal how fragile the achievements have been, underscoring deep shifts in the global landscape that portend a dark and difficult near future.<br /><br />,The nature of cyberspace makes attribution of cyber operations difficult but not impossible. Every kind of cyber operation\u2014malicious or not\u2014leaves a trail. US Intelligence Community analysts use this information, their constantly growing knowledge base of previous events and known malicious actors, and their knowledge of how these malicious actors work and the tools that they use, to attempt to trace these operations back to their source. In every case, they apply the same tradecraft standards described in the Analytic Process above.<br /><br />, ,This Joint Intelligence Bulletin (JIB) is intended to provide new insight into the targeting preferences of some homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) and to examine detection challenges and opportunities. This JIB is provided by FBI, DHS, and NCTC to support their respective activities and to assist federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government counterterrorism and law enforcement officials and private sector security partners in deterring, preventing, or disrupting terrorist attacks within the United States.<br /><br />In accordance with the President\u2019s direction and consistent with the President\u2019s commitment to providing as much information as possible to the American people about U.S. counterterrorism activities, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) is releasing today a summary of information provided to the DNI about both the number of strikes taken by the U.S. Government against terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities and the assessed number of combatant and non-combatant deaths resulting from those strikes. \u201cAreas of active hostilities\u201d currently include Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria.<br /><br />Examples of the National Counterterrorism Centers Counterterrorism Weekly for Americas Protectors from April 2016, a compilation of open source publicly available press and relevant commentary on issues related to terrorism and counterterrorism over the past seven days.<br /><br />Page 1 of 61<br /><br />&hellip;\ufeffSearch for:<br /><br />Follow UsA D V E R T I S E M E N T<br /><br />Categories&bull;", "publish_time": 1569727589895, "collection_time": 1569727589895, "summary": "", "source": "publicintelligence"}
{"url": "https://publicintelligence.net/category/documents/united-states-documents/government-accountability-office/", "title": "Government Accountability Office", "authors": "", "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) did not meet statutory military whistleblower reprisal 180-day notification requirements in about half of reprisal investigations closed in fiscal year 2013, and DOD\u2019s average investigation time for closed cases in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 was 526 days, almost three times DOD\u2019s internal 180-day requirement. In 2012, GAO made recommendations to improve investigation timeliness, and DOD has taken some actions to address those recommendations. However, based on a random sample of 124 cases, GAO estimated that there was no evidence that DOD sent the required notification letters in about 47 percent of the cases that DOD took longer than 180 days to close in fiscal year 2013. For cases in which DOD sent the required letter, GAO estimated that the median notification time was about 353 days after the servicemember filed the complaint, and on average the letters significantly underestimated the expected investigation completion date. DOD does not have a tool, such as an automated alert, to help ensure compliance with the statutory notification requirement to provide letters by 180 days informing servicemembers about delays in investigations. Without a tool for DOD to ensure that servicemembers receive reliable, accurate, and timely information about their investigations, servicemembers may be discouraged from reporting wrongdoing.<br /><br />Available evidence does not support whether behavioral indicators, which are used in the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s (TSA) Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques (SPOT) program, can be used to identify persons who may pose a risk to aviation security. GAO reviewed four meta-analyses (reviews that analyze other studies and synthesize their findings) that included over 400 studies from the past 60 years and found that the human ability to accurately identify deceptive behavior based on behavioral indicators is the same as or slightly better than chance. Further, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) April 2011 study conducted to validate SPOT\u2019s behavioral indicators did not demonstrate their effectiveness because of study limitations, including the use of unreliable data. Twenty-one of the 25 behavior detection officers (BDO) GAO interviewed at four airports said that some behavioral indicators are subjective. TSA officials agree, and said they are working to better define them. GAO analyzed data from fiscal years 2011 and 2012 on the rates at which BDOs referred passengers for additional screening based on behavioral indicators and found that BDOs\u2019 referral rates varied significantly across airports, raising questions about the use of behavioral indicators by BDOs. To help ensure consistency, TSA officials said they deployed teams nationally to verify compliance with SPOT procedures in August 2013. However, these teams are not designed to help ensure BDOs consistently interpret SPOT indicators.<br /><br />The Department of Justice (DOJ) has largely implemented the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative among fusion centers\u2014entities that serve as the focal point within a state for sharing and analyzing suspicious activity reports and other threat information. The state and local law enforcement officials GAO interviewed generally said the initiative\u2019s processes worked well, but that they could benefit from additional feedback from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on how the reports they submit are used. The FBI has a feedback mechanism, but not all stakeholders were aware of it. Implementing formalized feedback mechanisms as part of the initiative could help stakeholders conduct accurate analyses of terrorism-related information, among other things.<br /><br />The majority of state and local participant feedback on training that DHS or DOJ provided or funded and that GAO identified as CVE-related was positive or neutral, but a minority of participants raised concerns about biased, inaccurate, or offensive material. DHS and DOJ collected feedback from 8,424 state and local participants in CVE-related training during fiscal years 2010 and 2011, and 77\u2014less than 1 percent\u2014provided comments that expressed such concerns. According to DHS and DOJ officials, agencies used the feedback to make changes where appropriate. DOJ\u2019s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other components generally solicit feedback for more formal, curriculum-based training, but the FBI does not require this for activities such as presentations by guest speakers because the FBI does not consider this to be training. Similarly, DOJ\u2019s United States Attorneys\u2019 Offices (USAO) do not require feedback on presentations and similar efforts. Nevertheless, FBI field offices and USAOs covered about 39 percent (approximately 9,900) of all participants in DOJ CVE-related training during fiscal years 2010 and 2011 through these less formal methods, yet only 4 of 21 FBI field offices and 15 of 39 USAOs chose to solicit feedback on such methods. GAO has previously reported that agencies need to develop systematic evaluation processes in order to obtain accurate information about the benefits of their training. Soliciting feedback for less formal efforts on a more consistent basis could help these agencies ensure their quality.<br /><br />The Federal Reserve Act requires each Reserve Bank to be governed by a nine-member board\u2014three Class A directors elected by member banks to represent their interests, three Class B directors elected by member banks to represent the public, and three Class C directors that are appointed by the Federal Reserve Board to represent the public. The diversity of Reserve Bank boards was limited from 2006 to 2010. For example, in 2006 minorities accounted for 13 of 108 director positions, and in 2010 they accounted for 15 of 108 director positions. Specifically, in 2010 Reserve Bank directors included 78 white men, 15 white women, 12 minority men, and 3 minority women. According to the Federal Reserve Act, Class B and C directors are to be elected with due but not exclusive consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor, and consumer representation.<br /><br />As part of a systematic evaluation framework, agency policies should ensure organizational competence, evaluations of a system\u2019s effectiveness and privacy protections, executive review, and appropriate transparency throughout the system\u2019s life cycle. While DHS and three of its component agencies\u2014U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\u2014have established policies that address most of these key policy elements, the policies are not comprehensive. For example, DHS policies do not fully ensure executive review and transparency, and the component agencies\u2019 policies do not sufficiently require evaluating system effectiveness. DHS\u2019s Chief Information Officer reported that the agency is planning to improve its executive review process by conducting more intensive reviews of IT investments, including the data-mining systems reviewed in this report. Until such reforms are in place, DHS and its component agencies may not be able to ensure that critical data mining systems used in support of counterterrorism are both effective and that they protect personal privacy.<br /><br />DOE, NRC, and State are not able to fully account for U.S. nuclear material overseas that is subject to nuclear cooperation agreement terms because the agreements do not stipulate systematic reporting of such information, and there is no U.S. policy to pursue or obtain such information. Section 123 of the AEA, as amended, does not require nuclear cooperation agreements to contain provisions stipulating that partners report information on the amount, status, or location (facility) of special nuclear material subject to the agreement terms. However, U.S. nuclear cooperation agreements generally require that partners report inventory information upon request, although DOE and NRC have not systematically sought such data. We requested from multiple offices at DOE and NRC a current and comprehensive inventory of U.S. nuclear material overseas, to include country, site, or facility, and whether the quantity of material was rated as Category I or Category II material. However, neither agency has provided such an inventory. NMMSS does not contain the data necessary to maintain an inventory of U.S. special nuclear material overseas. DOE, NRC, and State have not pursued annual inventory reconciliations of nuclear material subject to U.S. cooperation agreement terms with all foreign partners that would provide the U.S. government with better information about where such material is held. Furthermore, according to DOE, NRC, and State officials, no U.S. law or policy directs U.S. agencies to obtain information regarding the location and disposition of U.S. nuclear material at foreign facilities.<br /><br />Since it began operations in 2003, DHS has implemented key homeland security operations and achieved important goals and milestones in many areas to create and strengthen a foundation to reach its potential. As it continues to mature, however, more work remains for DHS to address gaps and weaknesses in its current operational and implementation efforts, and to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of those efforts to achieve its full potential. DHS\u2019s accomplishments include developing strategic and operational plans; deploying workforces; and establishing new, or expanding existing, offices and programs.<br /><br />,On numerous occasions in 2008 and 2009, the Federal Reserve Board invoked emergency authority under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 to authorize new broad-based programs and financial assistance to individual institutions to stabilize financial markets. Loans outstanding for the emergency programs peaked at more than $1 trillion in late 2008. The Federal Reserve Board directed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) to implement most of these emergency actions. In a few cases, the Federal Reserve Board authorized a Reserve Bank to lend to a limited liability corporation (LLC) to finance the purchase of assets from a single institution. In 2009 and 2010, FRBNY also executed large-scale purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities to support the housing market. The table below provides an overview of all emergency actions covered by this report. The Reserve Banks\u2019 and LLCs\u2019 financial statements, which include the emergency programs\u2019 accounts and activities, and their related financial reporting internal controls, are audited annually by an independent auditing firm. These independent financial statement audits, as well as other audits and reviews conducted by the Federal Reserve Board, its Inspector General, and the Reserve Banks\u2019 internal audit function, did not report any significant accounting or financial reporting internal control issues concerning the emergency programs.<br /><br />GAO found that 40 executives for 10 companies received approximately $350 million in pay and other compensation in the years leading up to the termination of their companies\u2019 underfunded pension plans. GAO identified salaries, bonuses, and benefits provided to small groups of high-ranking executives at these companies during the 5 years leading up to the termination of their pension plans. For example, beyond the tens of millions in base salaries received, GAO found that executives also received millions of dollars in stock awards, income tax reimbursements, retention bonuses, severance packages, and supplemental executive-only retirement plans.<br /><br />Leadership roles and responsibilities for an influenza pandemic need to be clarified, tested, and exercised, and existing coordination mechanisms, such as critical infrastructure coordinating councils, could be better utilized to address challenges in coordination between the federal, state, and local governments and the private sector in preparing for a pandemic.<br /><br />Since 2004, HHS has awarded nine contracts using its Special Reserve Fund (Fund) purchasing authority under the BioShield Act to procure countermeasures that address anthrax, botulism, smallpox, and radiation poisoning. HHS may procure countermeasures that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration and ones that are unapproved, but are within 8 years of approval.<br /><br />FPS does not fully ensure that its contract security guards have the training and certifications required to be deployed to a federal facility. FPS requires that all prospective guards complete about 128 hours of training including 8 hours of x-ray and magnetometer training. However, in one region, FPS has not provided the x-ray or magnetometer training to its 1,500 guards since 2004. Nonetheless, these guards are assigned to posts at federal facilities. X-ray training is critical because guards control access points at facilities. Insufficient x-ray and magnetometer training may have contributed to several incidents where guards were negligent in carrying out their responsibilities. For example, at a level IV facility, an infant in a carrier was sent through an xray machine due to a guard\u2019s negligence. Moreover, GAO found that FPS does not have a fully reliable system for monitoring and verifying guard training and certification requirements. GAO reviewed 663 randomly selected guard records and found that 62 percent of the guards had at least one expired certification including a declaration that guards have not been convicted of domestic violence, which make them ineligible to carry firearms.<br /><br />As of March 27, 2009, Treasury had disbursed $303.4 billion of the $700 billion in TARP funds. Most of the funds (about $199 billion) went to purchase preferred shares of 532 financial institutions under the Capital Purchase Program (CPP)\u2014Treasury\u2019s primary vehicle under TARP for stabilizing financial markets. Treasury has continued to take significant steps to address all of the recommendations from our December 2008 and January 2009 reports. In particular, Treasury has recently expanded the scope of the monthly CPP surveys of the largest institutions to include all institutions participating in the program, which is intended to provide Treasury with information necessary to begin to track the effectiveness of the program. Treasury also continued to make progress in several other areas, including requiring firms participating in certain new programs to show how assistance will expand lending. These requirements will better enable Treasury to determine what institutions plan to do with any capital infusions and to track the resulting lending activity of participating institutions on a regular basis. In addition, we specifically found that though Treasury is now receiving dividends from the investments it has made in CPP and certain other programs, it has not publicly reported these receipts, which totaled almost $2.9 billion through March 20, 2009. We recommended that Treasury could improve transparency pertaining to TARP program activities by reporting publicly the monies, such as dividends, paid to Treasury by TARP participants.<br /><br />Since 2005, GAO has reported that DHS has yet to comprehensively satisfy its key cybersecurity responsibilities, including those related to establishing effective partnerships with the private sector. Shortcomings exist in key areas that are essential for DHS to address in order to fully implement its cybersecurity responsibilities (see table). DHS has since developed and implemented certain capabilities, but still has not fully satisfied aspects of these responsibilities and needs to take further action to enhance the public/private partnerships needed to adequately protect cyber critical infrastructure. GAO has also previously reported on significant security weaknesses in systems supporting two of the department\u2019s programs, one that tracks foreign nationals entering and exiting the United States, and one for matching airline passenger information against terrorist watch-list records. DHS has corrected information security weaknesses for systems supporting the terrorist watch-list, but needs to take additional actions to mitigate vulnerabilities associated with systems tracking foreign nationals.<br /><br />Eighty-three of the 100 largest publicly traded U.S. corporations in terms of 2007 revenue reported having subsidiaries in jurisdictions listed as tax havens or financial privacy jurisdictions. Sixty-three of the 100 largest publicly traded U.S. federal contractors in terms of fiscal year 2007 federal contract obligations reported having subsidiaries in such jurisdictions. Since subsidiaries may be established in listed jurisdictions for a variety of nontax business reasons, the existence of a subsidiary in a jurisdiction listed as a tax haven or financial privacy jurisdiction does not signify that a corporation or federal contractor established that subsidiary for the purpose of reducing its tax burden.<br /><br />\ufeffSearch for:<br /><br />Follow UsA D V E R T I S E M E N T<br /><br />Categories&bull;", "publish_time": 1569727582377, "collection_time": 1569727582378, "summary": "", "source": "publicintelligence"}

In 2009 and 2010, FRBNY also executed large-scale purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities to support the housing market. The table below provides an overview of all emergency actions covered by this report. The Reserve Banks\u2019 and LLCs\u2019 financial statements, which include the emergency programs\u2019 accounts and activities, and their related financial reporting internal controls, are audited annually by an independent auditing firm. These independent financial statement audits, as well as other audits and reviews conducted by the Federal Reserve Board, its Inspector General, and the Reserve Banks\u2019 internal audit function, did not report any significant accounting or financial reporting internal control issues concerning the emergency programs.<br /><br />GAO found that 40 executives for 10 companies received approximately $350 million in pay and other compensation in the years leading up to the termination of their companies\u2019 underfunded pension plans. GAO identified salaries, bonuses, and benefits provided to small groups of high-ranking executives at these companies during the 5 years leading up to the termination of their pension plans. For example, beyond the tens of millions in base salaries received, GAO found that executives also received millions of dollars in stock awards, income tax reimbursements, retention bonuses, severance packages, and supplemental executive-only retirement plans.<br /><br />Leadership roles and responsibilities for an influenza pandemic need to be clarified, tested, and exercised, and existing coordination mechanisms, such as critical infrastructure coordinating councils, could be better utilized to address challenges in coordination between the federal, state, and local governments and the private sector in preparing for a pandemic.<br /><br />Since 2004, HHS has awarded nine contracts using its Special Reserve Fund (Fund) purchasing authority under the BioShield Act to procure countermeasures that address anthrax, botulism, smallpox, and radiation poisoning. HHS may procure countermeasures that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration and ones that are unapproved, but are within 8 years of approval.<br /><br />FPS does not fully ensure that its contract security guards have the training and certifications required to be deployed to a federal facility. FPS requires that all prospective guards complete about 128 hours of training including 8 hours of x-ray and magnetometer training. However, in one region, FPS has not provided the x-ray or magnetometer training to its 1,500 guards since 2004. Nonetheless, these guards are assigned to posts at federal facilities. X-ray training is critical because guards control access points at facilities. Insufficient x-ray and magnetometer training may have contributed to several incidents where guards were negligent in carrying out their responsibilities. For example, at a level IV facility, an infant in a carrier was sent through an xray machine due to a guard\u2019s negligence. Moreover, GAO found that FPS does not have a fully reliable system for monitoring and verifying guard training and certification requirements. GAO reviewed 663 randomly selected guard records and found that 62 percent of the guards had at least one expired certification including a declaration that guards have not been convicted of domestic violence, which make them ineligible to carry firearms.<br /><br />As of March 27, 2009, Treasury had disbursed $303.4 billion of the $700 billion in TARP funds. Most of the funds (about $199 billion) went to purchase preferred shares of 532 financial institutions under the Capital Purchase Program (CPP)\u2014Treasury\u2019s primary vehicle under TARP for stabilizing financial markets. Treasury has continued to take significant steps to address all of the recommendations from our December 2008 and January 2009 reports. In particular, Treasury has recently expanded the scope of the monthly CPP surveys of the largest institutions to include all institutions participating in the program, which is intended to provide Treasury with information necessary to begin to track the effectiveness of the program. Treasury also continued to make progress in several other areas, including requiring firms participating in certain new programs to show how assistance will expand lending. These requirements will better enable Treasury to determine what institutions plan to do with any capital infusions and to track the resulting lending activity of participating institutions on a regular basis. In addition, we specifically found that though Treasury is now receiving dividends from the investments it has made in CPP and certain other programs, it has not publicly reported these receipts, which totaled almost $2.9 billion through March 20, 2009. We recommended that Treasury could improve transparency pertaining to TARP program activities by reporting publicly the monies, such as dividends, paid to Treasury by TARP participants.<br /><br />Since 2005, GAO has reported that DHS has yet to comprehensively satisfy its key cybersecurity responsibilities, including those related to establishing effective partnerships with the private sector. Shortcomings exist in key areas that are essential for DHS to address in order to fully implement its cybersecurity responsibilities (see table). DHS has since developed and implemented certain capabilities, but still has not fully satisfied aspects of these responsibilities and needs to take further action to enhance the public/private partnerships needed to adequately protect cyber critical infrastructure. GAO has also previously reported on significant security weaknesses in systems supporting two of the department\u2019s programs, one that tracks foreign nationals entering and exiting the United States, and one for matching airline passenger information against terrorist watch-list records. DHS has corrected information security weaknesses for systems supporting the terrorist watch-list, but needs to take additional actions to mitigate vulnerabilities associated with systems tracking foreign nationals.<br /><br />Eighty-three of the 100 largest publicly traded U.S. corporations in terms of 2007 revenue reported having subsidiaries in jurisdictions listed as tax havens or financial privacy jurisdictions. Sixty-three of the 100 largest publicly traded U.S. federal contractors in terms of fiscal year 2007 federal contract obligations reported having subsidiaries in such jurisdictions. Since subsidiaries may be established in listed jurisdictions for a variety of nontax business reasons, the existence of a subsidiary in a jurisdiction listed as a tax haven or financial privacy jurisdiction does not signify that a corporation or federal contractor established that subsidiary for the purpose of reducing its tax burden.<br /><br />\ufeffSearch for:<br /><br />Follow UsA D V E R T I S E M E N T<br /><br />Categories&bull;", "publish_time": 1569727582377, "collection_time": 1569727582378, "summary": "", "source": "publicintelligence"}
{"url": "https://publicintelligence.net/category/documents/united-states-documents/government-accountability-office/", "title": "Government Accountability Office", "authors": "", "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) did not meet statutory military whistleblower reprisal 180-day notification requirements in about half of reprisal investigations closed in fiscal year 2013, and DOD\u2019s average investigation time for closed cases in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 was 526 days, almost three times DOD\u2019s internal 180-day requirement. In 2012, GAO made recommendations to improve investigation timeliness, and DOD has taken some actions to address those recommendations. However, based on a random sample of 124 cases, GAO estimated that there was no evidence that DOD sent the required notification letters in about 47 percent of the cases that DOD took longer than 180 days to close in fiscal year 2013. For cases in which DOD sent the required letter, GAO estimated that the median notification time was about 353 days after the servicemember filed the complaint, and on average the letters significantly underestimated the expected investigation completion date. DOD does not have a tool, such as an automated alert, to help ensure compliance with the statutory notification requirement to provide letters by 180 days informing servicemembers about delays in investigations. Without a tool for DOD to ensure that servicemembers receive reliable, accurate, and timely information about their investigations, servicemembers may be discouraged from reporting wrongdoing.<br /><br />Available evidence does not support whether behavioral indicators, which are used in the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s (TSA) Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques (SPOT) program, can be used to identify persons who may pose a risk to aviation security. GAO reviewed four meta-analyses (reviews that analyze other studies and synthesize their findings) that included over 400 studies from the past 60 years and found that the human ability to accurately identify deceptive behavior based on behavioral indicators is the same as or slightly better than chance. Further, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) April 2011 study conducted to validate SPOT\u2019s behavioral indicators did not demonstrate their effectiveness because of study limitations, including the use of unreliable data. Twenty-one of the 25 behavior detection officers (BDO) GAO interviewed at four airports said that some behavioral indicators are subjective. TSA officials agree, and said they are working to better define them. GAO analyzed data from fiscal years 2011 and 2012 on the rates at which BDOs referred passengers for additional screening based on behavioral indicators and found that BDOs\u2019 referral rates varied significantly across airports, raising questions about the use of behavioral indicators by BDOs. To help ensure consistency, TSA officials said they deployed teams nationally to verify compliance with SPOT procedures in August 2013. However, these teams are not designed to help ensure BDOs consistently interpret SPOT indicators.<br /><br />The Department of Justice (DOJ) has largely implemented the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative among fusion centers\u2014entities that serve as the focal point within a state for sharing and analyzing suspicious activity reports and other threat information. The state and local law enforcement officials GAO interviewed generally said the initiative\u2019s processes worked well, but that they could benefit from additional feedback from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on how the reports they submit are used. The FBI has a feedback mechanism, but not all stakeholders were aware of it. Implementing formalized feedback mechanisms as part of the initiative could help stakeholders conduct accurate analyses of terrorism-related information, among other things.<br /><br />The majority of state and local participant feedback on training that DHS or DOJ provided or funded and that GAO identified as CVE-related was positive or neutral, but a minority of participants raised concerns about biased, inaccurate, or offensive material. DHS and DOJ collected feedback from 8,424 state and local participants in CVE-related training during fiscal years 2010 and 2011, and 77\u2014less than 1 percent\u2014provided comments that expressed such concerns. According to DHS and DOJ officials, agencies used the feedback to make changes where appropriate. DOJ\u2019s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other components generally solicit feedback for more formal, curriculum-based training, but the FBI does not require this for activities such as presentations by guest speakers because the FBI does not consider this to be training. Similarly, DOJ\u2019s United States Attorneys\u2019 Offices (USAO) do not require feedback on presentations and similar efforts. Nevertheless, FBI field offices and USAOs covered about 39 percent (approximately 9,900) of all participants in DOJ CVE-related training during fiscal years 2010 and 2011 through these less formal methods, yet only 4 of 21 FBI field offices and 15 of 39 USAOs chose to solicit feedback on such methods. GAO has previously reported that agencies need to develop systematic evaluation processes in order to obtain accurate information about the benefits of their training. Soliciting feedback for less formal efforts on a more consistent basis could help these agencies ensure their quality.<br /><br />The Federal Reserve Act requires each Reserve Bank to be governed by a nine-member board\u2014three Class A directors elected by member banks to represent their interests, three Class B directors elected by member banks to represent the public, and three Class C directors that are appointed by the Federal Reserve Board to represent the public. The diversity of Reserve Bank boards was limited from 2006 to 2010. For example, in 2006 minorities accounted for 13 of 108 director positions, and in 2010 they accounted for 15 of 108 director positions. Specifically, in 2010 Reserve Bank directors included 78 white men, 15 white women, 12 minority men, and 3 minority women. According to the Federal Reserve Act, Class B and C directors are to be elected with due but not exclusive consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor, and consumer representation.<br /><br />As part of a systematic evaluation framework, agency policies should ensure organizational competence, evaluations of a system\u2019s effectiveness and privacy protections, executive review, and appropriate transparency throughout the system\u2019s life cycle. While DHS and three of its component agencies\u2014U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\u2014have established policies that address most of these key policy elements, the policies are not comprehensive. For example, DHS policies do not fully ensure executive review and transparency, and the component agencies\u2019 policies do not sufficiently require evaluating system effectiveness. DHS\u2019s Chief Information Officer reported that the agency is planning to improve its executive review process by conducting more intensive reviews of IT investments, including the data-mining systems reviewed in this report. Until such reforms are in place, DHS and its component agencies may not be able to ensure that critical data mining systems used in support of counterterrorism are both effective and that they protect personal privacy.<br /><br />DOE, NRC, and State are not able to fully account for U.S. nuclear material overseas that is subject to nuclear cooperation agreement terms because the agreements do not stipulate systematic reporting of such information, and there is no U.S. policy to pursue or obtain such information. Section 123 of the AEA, as amended, does not require nuclear cooperation agreements to contain provisions stipulating that partners report information on the amount, status, or location (facility) of special nuclear material subject to the agreement terms. However, U.S. nuclear cooperation agreements generally require that partners report inventory information upon request, although DOE and NRC have not systematically sought such data. We requested from multiple offices at DOE and NRC a current and comprehensive inventory of U.S. nuclear material overseas, to include country, site, or facility, and whether the quantity of material was rated as Category I or Category II material. However, neither agency has provided such an inventory. NMMSS does not contain the data necessary to maintain an inventory of U.S. special nuclear material overseas. DOE, NRC, and State have not pursued annual inventory reconciliations of nuclear material subject to U.S. cooperation agreement terms with all foreign partners that would provide the U.S. government with better information about where such material is held. Furthermore, according to DOE, NRC, and State officials, no U.S. law or policy directs U.S. agencies to obtain information regarding the location and disposition of U.S. nuclear material at foreign facilities.<br /><br />Since it began operations in 2003, DHS has implemented key homeland security operations and achieved important goals and milestones in many areas to create and strengthen a foundation to reach its potential. As it continues to mature, however, more work remains for DHS to address gaps and weaknesses in its current operational and implementation efforts, and to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of those efforts to achieve its full potential. DHS\u2019s accomplishments include developing strategic and operational plans; deploying workforces; and establishing new, or expanding existing, offices and programs.<br /><br />,On numerous occasions in 2008 and 2009, the Federal Reserve Board invoked emergency authority under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 to authorize new broad-based programs and financial assistance to individual institutions to stabilize financial markets. Loans outstanding for the emergency programs peaked at more than $1 trillion in late 2008. The Federal Reserve Board directed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) to implement most of these emergency actions. In a few cases, the Federal Reserve Board authorized a Reserve Bank to lend to a limited liability corporation (LLC) to finance the purchase of assets from a single institution. In 2009 and 2010, FRBNY also executed large-scale purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities to support the housing market.

Analysis of four key areas is performed: technology, mission needs, economics, and existing or anticipated challenges to routine use in NAS operations. Forecast effects of emerging technologies as well as anticipating new technological innovations in areas of airframes, powerplants, sensors, communication, command and control systems, and information technology and processing are evaluated. Anticipated mission needs include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), as well as new areas such as stores delivery, cargo transport, search and rescue, and pilot augmentation; example business case models are developed for each of these areas. Challenges to routine UAS usage in the NAS include: absence of legislation and regulations for safe flight in integrated airspace; pilot training and certification; regulatory, policy, and procedural issues; social issues, such as privacy and nuisance concerns; environmental issues, such as noise and emissions; and safety.<br /><br />, , ,This publication identifies multi-Service tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) for Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) and Integrating with National Guard Civil Support. It sets forth MTTP at the tactical level to assist the military planner, commander, and individual Service forces in the employment of military resources in response to domestic emergencies in accordance with United States (US) law. This MTTP focuses on planning, preparation, execution, and assessment of DSCA operations conducted within the US and its territories.<br /><br />This functional concept details capabilities and effects necessary to perform operational cyberspace functions desired by the warfighter, from the present through 2030. This concept broadly describes how AFSPC intends to conduct cyberspace operations in support of both joint and AF operations of all types, and provides a foundation for developing more detailed concept documents. Moreover, AFSPC will use this concept, along with emerging joint guidance, to organize, train, and equip forces to conduct cyberspace operations.

In addition, they present an asymmetric threat to US airpower. Many ballistic and cruise missiles are armed with weapons of mass destruction.  Ballistic and cruise missiles present a significant threat to US and Allied forces overseas, and to the United States and its territories. Missiles are attractive to many nations because they can be used effectively against an adversary with a formidable air defense system, where an attack with manned aircraft would be impractical or too costly. In addition, missiles can be used as a deterrent or an instrument of coercion. Missiles also have the advantage of fewer maintenance, training, and logistic requirements than manned aircraft. Even limited use of these weapons could have devastating consequences because missiles can be armed with chemical, biological, or nuclear warheads.<br /><br />Nation-state adversaries regularly use accounts on popular social networking sites to facilitate social engineering against DoD members.

It serves as a reference to ensure coordinated multi-Service operations for planners and operators preparing for, and conducting, advisor team missions. This MTTP is intended to provide units and personnel that are scheduled to advise foreign forces (FF) with viable tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) so that they can successfully plan, train for, and carry out their mission. Currently, material regarding advising is found in joint and Service doctrinal treatment of foreign internal defense (FID), counterinsurgency (COIN), security assistance (SA), and unconventional warfare (UW). Several Services are developing documents that focus on basic survival and common advisor skills, but do not sufficiently cover how an advisor team might function at all levels. This MTTP provides guidance that will help to enhance the activities of some advisor functions and improve inter-Service coordination for this joint mission.<br /><br />Every year as technology grows and advances thus do the threats that surround it.

Analysis of four key areas is performed: technology, mission needs, economics, and existing or anticipated challenges to routine use in NAS operations. Forecast effects of emerging technologies as well as anticipating new technological innovations in areas of airframes, powerplants, sensors, communication, command and control systems, and information technology and processing are evaluated. Anticipated mission needs include intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), as well as new areas such as stores delivery, cargo transport, search and rescue, and pilot augmentation; example business case models are developed for each of these areas. Challenges to routine UAS usage in the NAS include: absence of legislation and regulations for safe flight in integrated airspace; pilot training and certification; regulatory, policy, and procedural issues; social issues, such as privacy and nuisance concerns; environmental issues, such as noise and emissions; and safety.<br /><br />, , ,This publication identifies multi-Service tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) for Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) and Integrating with National Guard Civil Support. It sets forth MTTP at the tactical level to assist the military planner, commander, and individual Service forces in the employment of military resources in response to domestic emergencies in accordance with United States (US) law. This MTTP focuses on planning, preparation, execution, and assessment of DSCA operations conducted within the US and its territories.<br /><br />This functional concept details capabilities and effects necessary to perform operational cyberspace functions desired by the warfighter, from the present through 2030. This concept broadly describes how AFSPC intends to conduct cyberspace operations in support of both joint and AF operations of all types, and provides a foundation for developing more detailed concept documents. Moreover, AFSPC will use this concept, along with emerging joint guidance, to organize, train, and equip forces to conduct cyberspace operations. Finally, this concept provides the operational perspective to underpin the many activities necessary to realize the AF institutional vision for a mature set of cyberspace capabilities.<br /><br />The United States Air Force (USAF) Blueprint for Cyberspace provides commander\u2019s guidance and intent, identifies opportunities and delineates objectives and strategies that will shape USAF actions over the next five years. This document describes the first phase of a two-phase approach. It defines specific actions to align cyber activities and functions, to evolve and integrate the unique capabilities the USAF brings to the joint fight, and to build cyberspace operational capacity.<br /><br />Many countries view ballistic and cruise missile systems as cost-effective weapons and symbols of national power. In addition, they present an asymmetric threat to US airpower. Many ballistic and cruise missiles are armed with weapons of mass destruction.  Ballistic and cruise missiles present a significant threat to US and Allied forces overseas, and to the United States and its territories. Missiles are attractive to many nations because they can be used effectively against an adversary with a formidable air defense system, where an attack with manned aircraft would be impractical or too costly. In addition, missiles can be used as a deterrent or an instrument of coercion. Missiles also have the advantage of fewer maintenance, training, and logistic requirements than manned aircraft. Even limited use of these weapons could have devastating consequences because missiles can be armed with chemical, biological, or nuclear warheads.<br /><br />Nation-state adversaries regularly use accounts on popular social networking sites to facilitate social engineering against DoD members. Information disclosed or discovered on social networking sites creates a significant operations security (OPSEC) concern and in the context of a wide spread collection effort could be by adversaries to form a classified picture.<br /><br />This Special Product was produced in response to reports of Department of Defense (DoD) personnel becoming victims of internet-based extortion scams known as sextortion. Its purpose is to inform United States Air Force (USAF) personnel of this new online scam and offer mitigating steps that can reduce the chances of becoming a victim.<br /><br />, , ,This publication provides multi-Service tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) to standardize and describe the use of internet tactical chat (TC) in support of operations. Thus, it provides commanders and their units with guidelines to facilitate coordination and integration of TC when conducting multi-Service and joint force operations.<br /><br />,This Statement of Work (SOW) involves purchasing and installing a Lawful Intercept (LI) capability for the Government of Iraq (GOI).

AOMSW is intended to support the joint force commander\u2019s (JFC\u2019s) objectives by providing capabilities/forces in support of joint maritime operations. The end state of this publication is a streamlined support process for maritime surface warfare within the joint force maritime component commander\u2019s (JFMCC\u2019s) area of operations (AO).<br /><br />The Air Force Public Affairs Agency created this guide to help all Airmen safely and wisely use social media. This guide provides simple, easy-to-follow tips to help you use social media tools in your professional and personal life. This guide is for informational purposes only and does not replace official Air Force instructions.<br /><br />Several statistics reports on unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) mishaps that are compiled yearly by the Air Force Safety Center.  The following reports are the most recent that are publicly available.<br /><br />\u201cEnduring Airpower Lessons from Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF) and Operation IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF)\u201d is one of three lessons learned (L2) focus areas directed by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) at CORONA Top 2008. This report is the third and last in a series of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) L2 reports produced for fiscal year 2009 and focuses on Small UAS (SUAS) capabilities and issues.<br /><br />, , ,JFIRE is a pocket-size, quick-reference guide for requesting fire support in accordance with approved joint tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). JFIRE contains calls for fire, joint air attack team (JAAT) techniques, a format for joint air strike requests, close air support (CAS) coordination and planning procedures, communications architecture, and weapons data.<br /><br />, , ,This multi-Service tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP) publication will assist in advising foreign forces. It serves as a reference to ensure coordinated multi-Service operations for planners and operators preparing for, and conducting, advisor team missions. This MTTP is intended to provide units and personnel that are scheduled to advise foreign forces (FF) with viable tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) so that they can successfully plan, train for, and carry out their mission. Currently, material regarding advising is found in joint and Service doctrinal treatment of foreign internal defense (FID), counterinsurgency (COIN), security assistance (SA), and unconventional warfare (UW). Several Services are developing documents that focus on basic survival and common advisor skills, but do not sufficiently cover how an advisor team might function at all levels. This MTTP provides guidance that will help to enhance the activities of some advisor functions and improve inter-Service coordination for this joint mission.<br /><br />Every year as technology grows and advances thus do the threats that surround it. Predicting what new cyber threats to look for may not always be an easy task. By keeping up with the past trends and ever changing current environment, may help to give us a good handle on how to prepare for what may be to come.<br /><br />U.S. Air Force presentation detailing human interface systems for drone ground control stations from May 2010.<br /><br />RPAs are revolutionary surveillance and weapons delivery systems \u2013 changing the way the Air Force builds situation awareness and engages enemy forces \u2013 but their full potential has yet to be realized.

{"url": "https://publicintelligence.net/category/documents/united-states-documents/federal-bureau-of-investigation-documents/", "title": "Federal Bureau of Investigation", "authors": "", "content": "Over a number of years, data collected by the FBIs Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted {LEOKA} Program began to demonstrate an alarming trend in the number of officers who were killed in ambushes and unprovoked attacks. While the overall number of officers who were feloniously killed was declining, the percentage of officers feloniously killed during surprise attacks was increasing. The LEOKA Program launched a thorough examination of ambushes and unprovoked attacks in an effort to gain insight into the phenomenon and to provide information to enhance training programs for law enforcement officers. The research focused on the mindset and perceptions of officers involved and offenders who carried out those acts. In particular, why the incidents may have occurred and how those involved reacted to the situation.<br /><br />The FBI identified incidents over the past few months in which cyber actors scanned for and sought to exploit audio and visual communication devices on networks to identify vulnerabilities which could later be used to gain access and unlawfully acquire information about the organization. In addition to targeting corporate information, vulnerable devices may be targeted for compromise for use in botnets or other criminal activities. The types of devices targeted include: Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phones, video conferencing equipment, conference phones, VoIP routers, and cloud-based communication systems. While cyber actors have targeted VoIP and other communication devices in the past, the FBI continues to see these devices scanned by cyber actors for vulnerabilities.<br /><br />The FBI assesses anti-government, identity based, and fringe political conspiracy theories very likely motivate some domestic extremists, wholly or in part, to commit criminal and sometimes violent activity. The FBI further assesses in some cases these conspiracy theories very likely encourage the targeting of specific people, places, and organizations, thereby increasing the likelihood of violence against these targets. These assessments are made with high confidence, based on information from other law enforcement agencies, open source information, court documents, human sources with varying degrees of access and corroboration, and FBI investigations.<br /><br />The FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office, in coordination with the FBI\u2019s Office of Private Sector (OPS), is informing private sector partners regarding foreign intelligence services\u2019 (FIS) exploitation of social media platforms and data to target corporate and US government (USG) clearance holders. FIS and US adversary intelligence officers are using popular US-based social media platforms to identify, recruit, and conduct operations against USG clearance holders, to include private sector employees or contractors supporting the USG. FIS officers will use popular US-based platforms and their respective countries\u2019 social media platforms for personal and intelligence gathering/operations purposes.<br /><br />A reference guide released by the FBI National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime (NCAVC) Behavioral Analysis Unit in March 2018 listing potential warning signs and concerning behaviors that may be exhibited by perpetrators of school shootings.<br /><br />, ,This Joint Intelligence Bulletin (JIB) is intended to provide information on the recent video appearance by the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The video addresses the group\u2019s territorial defeat in Syria, discusses the acceptance of pledges of allegiance from ISIS supporters, and praises recent attacks in Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia. This JIB is provided by the FBI, DHS, and NCTC to support their respective activities and to assist federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government counterterrorism and law enforcement officials and private sector security partners in deterring, preventing, or disrupting terrorist attacks against the United States. All video details described in this JIB are taken from the translated transcript of Baghdadi\u2019s speech.<br /><br />,With the expanded use of Huawei Technologies Inc. equipment and services in US telecommunications service provider networks, the Chinese Government\u2019s potential access to US business communications is dramatically increasing. China\u2019s intelligence services and Chinese cyber actors could exploit Chinese Government-supported telecommunication equipment on US networks operating as an advanced persistent threat. China makes no secret that its cyber warfare strategy is predicated on controlling global communications network infrastructure.<br /><br />, ,This Joint Intelligence Bulletin (JIB) is intended to provide information on Australian national and violent extremist Brenton Tarrant\u2019s 15 March 2019 attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. These attacks underscore the enduring nature of violent threats posed to faith-based communities. FBI, DHS, and NCTC advise federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government counterterrorism and law enforcement officials and private sector security partners responsible for securing faith-based communities in the Homeland to remain vigilant in light of the enduring threat to faith-based communities posed by domestic extremists (DEs), as well as by homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) who may seek retaliation.<br /><br />The FBI has identified successful spearphishing campaigns directed at college and university students, especially during periods when financial aid funds are disbursed in large volumes. In general, the spearphishing emails request students\u2019 login credentials for the University\u2019s internal intranet. The cyber criminals then capture students\u2019 login credentials, and after gaining access, change the students\u2019 direct deposit destination to bank accounts within the threat actor\u2019s control.<br /><br />The number of active shooter incidents in schools (ASIS) has remained steady over the past 18 years, with an average of 2.8 shootings per year. ASIS are most likely to happen at the high school level or higher (37 out of 52). The average deaths from ASIS was 7.4; however, this includes the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting and the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, where 32 and 26 people died, respectively. Most of the deaths from ASIS resulted during incidents that met the threshold for a mass killing (81 percent).<br /><br />On October 1, 2017, over 22,000 people gathered for a music festival at a 15-acre, open-air concert venue in Las Vegas, Nevada. On the final night of the festival, Stephen Craig Paddock opened fire into the crowd from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. The gunfire started around 10:05 p.m. and continued for approximately eleven minutes, with Paddock firing over 1,000 rounds. Fifty-eight persons were killed and several hundred more were injured. As responding law enforcement officers assembled in the hallway outside of his hotel room, Paddock committed suicide.<br /><br />In 2017 there were 30 separate active shootings in the United States, the largest number ever recorded by the FBI during a one-year period.1 With so many attacks occurring, it can become easy to believe that nothing can stop an active shooter determined to commit violence. \u201cThe offender just snapped\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s no way that anyone could have seen this coming\u201d are common reactions that can fuel a collective sense of a \u201cnew normal,\u201d one punctuated by a sense of hopelessness and helplessness. Faced with so many tragedies, society routinely wrestles with a fundamental question: can anything be done to prevent attacks on our loved ones, our children, our schools, our churches, concerts, and communities?<br /><br />,In March 2018, an identified financial services corporation received a thumb drive infected with the bank credential-stealing Qakbot malware variant, targeting information from networked computers and financial institution web sites. The financial services corporation purchased bulk thumb drives from a US online retailer of computer hardware. The thumb drives were originally manufactured in China. According to FBI forensic analysis, the Qakbot malware was on the infected thumb drive before the drive arrived in the United States. Qakbot is extremely persistent and requires removal of all malware from every device. Failure to remove even one node of malware may result in re-infecting previously sanitized systems possibly costing the victim hundreds of thousands of dollars in malware removal and system downtime.<br /><br />As with past FBI active shooter-related publications, this report does not encompass all gun-related situations. Rather, it focuses on a specific type of shooting situation. The FBI defines an active shooter as one or more individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area. Implicit in this definition is the shooter\u2019s use of one or more firearms. The active aspect of the definition inherently implies that both law enforcement personnel and citizens have the potential to affect the outcome of the event based upon their responses to the situation.<br /><br />The Office of Private Sector, in coordination with the Criminal Investigative Division, is providing this LIR to inform private sector partners about the increasing use of e-mail account compromise (EAC) techniques in the US real estate settlement industry. Consumer borrowers, settlement/title companies, real estate agents, real estate attorneys, builders, and others are being targeted by criminal actors netting millions in illicit proceeds. These proceeds are often directed initially to US banks then re-directed via money service businesses and international accounts to Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, China, Ghana, Turkey, and India. The increased use of EAC techniques, as well as, the evolving expansion into previously unidentified countries indicates this fraud scheme is not slowing and puts additional strain on industry participants to be vigilant with their e-mail communications and identity verification processes.<br /><br />APT actors in the near future likely intend to target US Cleared Defense Contractors (CDC) via spear phishing campaigns or network infrastructure compromises, according to recent intelligence. Common spear phish targets may include individuals featured on internet-facing CDC Web sites and high-ranking CDC executives.<br /><br />, ,The late 2016 arrest of two California teenagers for allegedly planning a \u201cmass casualty event\u201d by carrying out a chemical attack at a local high school pep rally highlights how individuals can use online resources to plan crude chemical or biological attacks. Violent extremists continue to circulate often ineffective or misleading how-to instructions for producing and disseminating poisons, crude biological toxins, and toxic industrial chemicals that in many cases are commercially available and easy to obtain. While we have no indication the suspects in this case subscribed to or consumed material related to violent extremist ideologies, their activity highlights one path to conducting a potential chemical or biological attack.<br /><br />Since April 2016, a loosely affiliated group of highly trained hackers calling themselves TheDarkOverlord (TDO) have conducted various extortion schemes with a recent focus on the public school system. TDO used remote access tools to breach school district networks and then proceeded to steal sensitive data. To extort money from its victims, including students, TDO threatened violence or the release of stolen sensitive data.<br /><br />, ,There is continued terrorist interest in attacking the rail system either as the primary target or as an attack mechanism. The US railroad system includes 800 railroads, 144,000 miles of track, and 212,000 railroad crossings. First responders should work closely with railroad police departments and other security partners to better protect rail assets\u2014including freight rail (railcars loaded with commodities or hazardous materials), passenger rail (Amtrak, regional, or commuter rail), heavy rail (metro, and subway), and light rail (street cars, tramways, or trolleys)\u2014from terrorist attacks and criminal activities. This product was developed to provide general rail safety tips and resources to help increase first responder awareness of the rail environment.<br /><br />, ,Food and agriculture infrastructure is a $1 trillion industry, almost entirely under private ownership and comprises an estimated 2.1 million farms, 935,000 restaurants, and more than 200,000 registered food manufacturing, processing, and storage facilities. Intentional contamination of the food supply could have significant public health and economic consequences depending on the commodity, the agent used, and where in the supply chain the contaminant was added. This product provides first responders and private-sector stakeholders an awareness of the complex operating environment that may result from intentional contamination of the food supply and identifies key collaborative partners and indicators to minimize the risk of an intentional attack on the food supply.<br /><br />, ,The fusion center has no information to indicate specific or credible threats to people whose names have been published online by violent extremists. You are being provided this advisory to assist your agency in responding to queries from members of the public or other concerned parties. This information, which often includes personally identifiable information (PII) obtained maliciously via the Internet, most likely represents aspirational threats. Its primary purpose is likely to heighten anxiety and a sense of vulnerability. It is unlikely that violent extremist-inspired individuals in the United States will target people identified online, but this cannot be ruled out entirely.<br /><br />, ,The number of criminal and gang-related assaults involving acid or other corrosive substances has risen sharply in some Western countries. As of July 2017, police statistics in England indicate assaults and threats involving corrosives have risen from 183 in 2012 to more than 500 this year, according to open source reporting. Although there has been minimal specific interest by terrorists in acid attacks to date, we judge the increase in criminal incidents coupled with recent English-language terrorist messaging encouraging attacks using acid may spur opportunistic terrorist use of the tactic, underscoring the potential threat and importance of an immediate on-scene emergency response.<br /><br />The FBI assesses it is very likely Black Identity Extremist (BIE) perceptions of police brutality against African Americans spurred an increase in premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and will very likely serve as justification for such violence. The FBI assess it is very likely this increase began following the 9 August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the subsequent Grand Jury November 2014 declination to indict the police officers involved. The FBI assesses it is very likely incidents of alleged police abuse against African Americans since then have continued to feed the resurgence in ideologically motivated, violent criminal activity within the BIE movement. The FBI assesses it is very likely some BIEs are influenced by a mix of anti-authoritarian, Moorish sovereign citizen ideology, and BIE ideology. The FBI has high confidence in these assessments, based on a history of violent incidents attributed to individuals who acted on behalf of their ideological beliefs, documented in FBI investigations and other law enforcement and open source reporting. The FBI makes this judgment with the key assumption the recent incidents are ideologically motivated.<br /><br />, ,This case study is an examination of behaviors that resulted in a disrupted terrorist attack, revealing a cycle of planning and preparation that could provide indicators for preventing similar attempts. The terrorist attack planning cycle is not a static, linear process but rather could begin in any of the several stages with variances in details, sequence, and timing. An individual\u2019s mobilization to violence often provides observable behavioral indicators such as, pre-attack surveillance, training, and rehearsal. The indicators potentially allow third-party observers and law enforcement to identify individuals moving to violence, circumstances that may allow for disruption of planned attacks. This product is intended to cultivate an awareness of the planning cycle among stakeholders for identification, mitigation, and disruption of attack planning.<br /><br />, ,The Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) is attempting to obtain money from organ harvesting, including from its own injured members, captives, and deceased individuals. Identification, prevention, and interdiction of organ harvesting and trafficking is a highly complex issue which may be effectively addressed through international partnerships among governmental, health, law enforcement, legal, and private-sector entities.<br /><br />Page 1 of 111<br /><br />&hellip;\ufeffSearch for:<br /><br />Follow UsA D V E R T I S E M E N T<br /><br />Categories&bull;", "publish_time": 1569727572355, "collection_time": 1569727572356, "summary": "The FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office, in coordination with the FBI\u2019s Office of Private Sector (OPS), is informing private sector partners regarding foreign intelligence services\u2019 (FIS) exploitation of social media platforms and data to target corporate and US government (USG) clearance holders.", "source": "publicintelligence"}

Since then, we have published two more reports from the Virginia Fusion Center, including a For Official Use Only Education Facilities Threat Assessment and a Law Enforcement Sensitive report on the Mara Salvatrucha 13 (MS-13) street gang.<br /><br />On August 5, 2010 we received a message from a Riyas Paramban who purportedly represents the Information Technology and Services (IT&#038;S) Digital Security Alert Centre of BP plc.  The notice requests that we remove a document concerning BPs use of RFID technology for tracking not only equipment, but its own employees, specifying that the material is BP Confidential and disclosure of this document may lead to security breach.<br /><br />On July 29, 2010, Public Intelligence received a notice from Paul Malcolm of Booz Allen Hamilton in support of the U.S. Air Force Key Management Infrastructure program.  Mr. Malcolm is very polite in requesting the removal of two For Official Use Only documents, one of which, he says, is proprietary.  Both documents concern the Simple Key Loader, a fill device used to load cryptographic keys into encryption systems.  The first document is the U.S. Air Force SKL Wireless &#038; Black Data Distribution System Overview.  The second is the Simple Key Loader Instruction Guide.  Neither of the documents bear any particular markings indicating their proprietary nature.  While he does not specify which document is proprietary, it is possible that the SKL Instruction Guide is thought to be proprietary because it concerns the functioning and operation of a device produced under contract and ostensibly owned by the Sierra Nevada Corporation.  In fact, it is from the official website of the Sierra Nevada Corporation that both of these documents were originally and inadvertently made available.  One is still available.<br /><br />In a rather bizaare turn of events, representatives of FEMA have again contacted us requesting the removal of a document from out site.  Previously, we were contacted by FEMA regarding the \u201cNational Level Exercise 2010 (NLE 10) Exercise Overview\u201d  which we had posted more than seven months prior.  This time they are requesting that we remove one of the first documents that we ever posted in May 2009.  The document is a brief presentation discussing Electronic Designation and Validation of Federal/Emergency Response Officials (F/EROs) in support of National Preparedness in the National Capital Region.  In fact, it has only 25 slides in its entirety.<br /><br />Allen-Vanguard Corporations threat to Public Intelligence, June 18, 2010.<br /><br />The following notice was received by our main hosting provider LeaseWeb BV from the attorneys of Visa International Service Association on June 15, 2010.<br /><br />Public Intelligence has received a message from Captain Douglas R. Keyer, Jr. of the New York State Police requesting the removal of a fourteen-page Gang Intelligence Newsletter from November 2009 that is labeled For Official Use Only and Law Enforcement Sensitive.  The document, which was published March 31, is evidently part of a series of monthly Gang Intelligence Newsletters that are issued to law enforcement personnel around the country.  The newsletter contains brief profiles of the Aryan Brotherhood, National Socialist Movement, as well as some information on identifying gang tattoos and graffiti.  This is also the second notice we have received that specifically requests us to identify the source of our information.<br /><br />During the month of April 2010, we have received the same message twice from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department concerning a Law Enforcement Sensitive brief entitled Silver Shield: Nevadas Approach to Critical Infrastructure Protection from November 2007.  The briefing discusses various aspects of Suspicious Activity Reporting, Fusion Center integration, and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to patrol portions of the city for aerial photography during incident response.<br /><br />On April 19, 2010, Public Intelligence received a notice from George White, Information Security Officer for the Federal Bureau of Investigations Criminal Justice Information Services Division, requesting the removal of a For Official Use Only document posted less than one day prior.  The Criminal Justice Information Services Security Policy is a draft document dated January 1, 2011 discussing the security procedures and implementation of future additions to the CJIS system.<br /><br />On April 13, 2010, we received a message from Danny Rains who is an investigator for the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the Office of Security requesting the removal of a document entitled National Level Exercise 2010 (NLE 10) Exercise Overview. The ten page document, which is described in FEMAs request as very sensitive, consists of approximately 20 PowerPoint slides including the title page and was published nearly seven months ago on August 8, 2009.  The document is labeled For Official Use Only and is marked as a draft copy.  The contents of the brief are basically a calender of potential dates for the exercise and very brief descriptions of some preliminary plans for the exercise.  The document has already been seen by a large number of people and has been discussed on a variety of  websites and forums, including mirrors in some cases.<br /><br />The following message was received on April 5, 2010 from a Captain Brad Carnduff of the Illinois Statewide Terrorism and Intelligence Center.  This is the third notice we have received from a U.S. fusion center.  The previous two notices, from the Virginia Fusion Center and the Rocky Mountain Information Network, were both received in the month of February.  This notice is unique in that it requests the identity of the person, group or organization who forwarded this Daily Intelligence Note to your attention.  It also asks that we contact the STIC prior to posting similar material in the future.<br /><br />In the month of February, we have received multiple notices from U.S. Intelligence Fusion Centers requesting the removal of documents from our archive.  The notices originated from the following entities:<br /><br />1. Virginia Fusion Center<br /><br />2. Rocky Mountain Information Network<br /><br />To whom it may concern,<br /><br />Please take this e-mail as an official request to remove the above listed posting as well as the five .pdf files and the zip file containing the five separate files.  These items are marked as law enforcement sensitive and were not intended for non LEO consumption.  The original source of your information did not have the authority to post these documents on a publicly available server and removed access to them immediately after being requested to do so.  Please respond to this e-mail as to your intentions in this matter.

In January 2016, EPIC produced a bulletin detailing how data provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and open source reporting indicated that Mexican TCOs had not been adversely affected by marijuana legalization in numerous markets, noting instead that the effort of legalization had conversely brought new opportunities for illicit profits from marijuana sales.<br /><br />The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) has released a 2017 version of their handbook for spotting indicators of mobilization to violence among homegrown violent extremists (HVEs).\u00a0 The guide was originally intended for distribution among public safety personnel and is not intended&hellip;<br /><br />A joint intelligence bulletin issued in late August by the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, and National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) assesses that homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) are increasingly favoring civilian targets as opposed to government facilities and personnel.  Previous assessments have found that HVEs are most likely to prioritize law enforcement personnel, military members, and US Government-associated targets.  However, a recent shift towards civilian targets has likely been driven by the accessibility of soft targets that are less secure and provide greater opportunities for mass casualty attacks.<br /><br />A Department of Homeland Security assessment released in April states that critical infrastructure throughout the U.S. faces immeasurable vulnerabilities and attack vectors due to the increasingly prominent role of information and communication technology (ICT) in critical infrastructure sectors.  The strategic risk assessment, authored by the Office of Cyber and Infrastructure Analysis within DHS, was obtained by Public Intelligence and describes the convergence of cyber and physical domains as a strategic threat to the nations infrastructure.<br /><br />There is currently a low threat of damaging cyber attacks against the U.S. energy infrastructure according an intelligence assessment released by the Department of Homeland Security and Industrial Control Systems Computer Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) in January.  While advanced persistent threat (APT) nation-state cyber actors are targeting US energy sector enterprise networks, these activities are conducted primarily in support of cyber espionage focused primarily on acquiring and maintaining persistent access to facilitate the introduction of malware in the event of hostilities with the United States.<br /><br />Cyber attacks against law enforcement, fire departments and other emergency services have become increasingly common and are likely to increase according to a recent intelligence assessment prepared by the Department of Homeland Security and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC).  The assessment, which was distributed to law enforcement in September 2015 and was obtained by Public Intelligence, reviewed a number of cyber attacks against the [emergency services sector or ESS] between February 2012 and May 2015, finding that targeting of the ESS will likely increase as ESS systems and networks become more interconnected and the ESS becomes more dependent on information technology for the conduct of daily operations\u2014creating a wider array of attack vectors for cyber targeting.<br /><br />Since 2009 Philadelphia has seen a 43 percent increase in drug-related overdose deaths, helping to make Pennsylvania the nations leading state for drug overdose death among young men.\u00a0 Over the same period, the city has seen a 45 percent increase&hellip;<br /><br />An analysis of recent suicide bombings throughout the Middle East, Europe and Africa by the FBI Terrorism Explosive Device Analytical Center (TEDAC) that was released after the terrorist attacks in Paris, France last month states that suicide vest and belt improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in the Middle Eastern, African, and European regions likely . . . have minimal correlation and do not indicate tactical migration.<br /><br />Foreign fighters are pouring into Iraq and Syria from all over the world to take up arms with the Islamic State (ISIL).  Recent reports have estimated that as many as 30,000 foreign fighters may be fighting in Iraq and Syria and that they are flowing in at a rate of nearly 1,000 new recruits a month.  However, a recently emerging phenomenon of Western individuals, primarily veterans, returning to Iraq and Syria to fight against ISIL forces has only recently begun to receive significant media attention.  No one has a precise number on how many Westerners are actually fighting in the conflict against ISIL, though estimates often place the number somewhere around 100-130 foreign fighters.<br /><br />We are transitioning PGP keys in conjunction with the establishment of new security procedures.  We are moving from our old key (0x5FE1B448) to our new key (0xD0516538).<br /><br />The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Department of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&#038;A) have both responded to recent requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for all records related to or mentioning the website Public Intelligence with a glomar response, refusing to admit the existence or nonexistence of records related to the request.<br /><br />The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has become the preeminent terror group among U.S.-based extremists according to an assessment authored by the Department of Homeland Security and more than a dozen state and local fusion centers. Individuals determined to fight overseas in a Muslim-majority country or conduct attacks domestically will be more likely to derive inspiration from ISIL than [al-Qaeda] or any of its affiliates as long as ISIL can maintain its current level of perceived legitimacy and relevancy. This assessment of ISILs increasing popularity among domestic extremists is the focus of a ten page Field Analysis Report obtained by Public Intelligence titled Assessing ISILs Influence and Perceived Legitimacy in the Homeland: A State and Local Perspective. Drawing on suspicious activity reports from around the country as well as intelligence reporting from DHS and the Bureau of Prisons, the report finds that ISILs military successes in Iraq and Syria along with the groups self-proclaimed re-establishment of the caliphate have captured the attention of violent extremists likely to buy in to its violent extremist counterculture.<br /><br />U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) has blocked access to the Public Intelligence website (publicintelligence.net) as well as at least 2,484 other WIKILEAKS-related websites on their unclassified network.<br /><br />A joint intelligence bulletin released by the Department of Homeland Security and FBI to coincide with the twentieth anniversary of the Oklahoma City Bombing warns that domestic extremism will remain a persistent threat through the end of 2015 and beyond with high confidence that lone offenders and those who pursue leaderless resistance continue to pose the greatest threat of violence.  The bulletin, which is based on recent patterns of extremist activity often taken by those who plan and act alone or in small cells, states that domestic extremism remains a persistent threat, and the United States has experienced violent ideologically-motivated criminal acts, both prior to and after the Oklahoma City attack including assaults, arsons, shootings, and use, or attempted use, of improvised incendiary and explosive devices, resulting in death, injury, and property damage.  Moreover, the bulletin states that many of the same motivations used by domestic extremists to justify their criminal acts in the mid-1990s\u2014anti-government and anti-law enforcement sentiment; racial, ethnic, and religious hatred; and advocacy of violent conspiracy theories\u2014continue to influence domestic extremists and their targeting choices in 2015.<br /><br />The innovative use of social media and messaging by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has played a key role in motivating young Western males and females to travel to the Syrian conflict to join and support the self-declared Islamic State according to a join intelligence bulletin released by the Department of Homeland Security and FBI last month.  The 5-page bulletin titled ISIL Social Media Messaging Resonating with Western Youth was disseminated to law enforcement throughout the country at the end of February to report on the continuing trend of Western youth being inspired to travel to Syria and join ISIL forces.  According to the bulletin, this trend is aided by the fact that Western youth are willing to connect over social media with like-minded persons, and have proven adept at obfuscating such social media usage from their parents and guardians.<br /><br />A bulletin issued in December 2014 by the Virgina Fusion Center (VFC) warned law enforcement and first responders that emergency vehicles could be targeted by violent protesters seeking to retaliate against the perceived surveillance of their activities. The bulletin, which is titled Malicious Activists May Promote Harm to Emergency Management Vehicles Observed During Violent Protests, draws its conclusion that violent or malicious activity could be directed toward emergency vehicles operating near protest areas based primarily upon comments to a post on Reddit and a protest guide posted anonymously on Pastebin.<br /><br />The FBI has issued a National Situational Information Report (NSIR) to law enforcement around the country warning of copy cat assassinations following the murder of two New York Police Department (NYPD) officers in December.

The assessment, which was obtained by Public Intelligence, was released in October following several recent attacks conducted in Europe and Australia by individuals sympathetic to ISIL.  Based on a review of these and other planned attacks, analysts at DHS evaluated the tactics and targets, as well as operational security measures employed in order to determine tactics, targets, and tradecraft that potentially could be used in the Homeland by individuals associated with or inspired by ISIL.<br /><br />The FBI Cyber Division has issued a notification to private industry and law enforcement to be aware of the potential for retaliatory cyber attacks following recent U.S. military actions in the Middle East. While the FBI has no information at this time to indicate specific cyber threats to US networks or infrastructure in response to ongoing US military air strikes against the terrorist group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) the bulletin states that the FBI believes that extremist hackers and hacktivist groups, including but not limited to those aligned with the ISIL ideology, will continue to threaten and may attempt offensive cyber actions against the United States in response to perceived or actual US military operations in Iraq or Syria.<br /><br />First time I ever saw an Afghan Police Station I thought it was something straight out of the dark ages, complete with zero electricity, mud structure, and no sewage drainage.

Cyber attacks have increased in both frequency and sophistication resulting in significant challenges to organizations that must defend their infrastructure from attacks by capable adversaries. These adversaries range from individual attackers to well-resourced groups operating as part of a criminal enterprise or on behalf of a nation-state. These adversaries are persistent, motivated, and agile; and employ a variety of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to compromise systems, disrupt services, commit financial fraud, expose sensitive information, and steal intellectual property. To enhance incident response actions and bolster cyber defenses, organizations must harness the collective wisdom of peer organizations through information sharing and coordinated incident response.

In a dynamically changing world, the nature and character of warfare, deterrence, compellence, escalation management, and persuasion are key and essential in determining how the United States and its partners should:<br /><br />\u2022 Strategize to defend their global interests against activities that are intended to undercut those interests across the spectrum of competition;<br /><br />\u2022 Defend their interests against threats by regional competitors via ways and means complementary to strategies vis-\u00e0-vis China and Russia but do not undercut other interests; and<br /><br />\u2022 Prepare US and partner forces to respond to unexpected and agile developments in global politics and technology by identifying areas for cooperation, mitigating the threat of activities short of armed conflict, and deterring armed conflict across multiple sources of national power (e.g., trade, diplomacy, security).<br /><br />The National Security Strategy (NSS), National Defense Strategy (NDS), and National Military Strategy all note that future confrontations between major powers may most often occur below the level of armed conflict. In this environment, economic competition, influence campaigns, paramilitary actions, cyber intrusions, and political warfare will likely become more prevalent. Such confrontations increase the risk of misperception and miscalculation, between powers with significant military strength, which may then increase the risk of armed conflict. In this context, the US capability to influence the outcomes of both global and regional events must be reconsidered. The growing divergence among great powers (i.e., the US, China, and Russia) regarding what constitutes legitimate or acceptable deterrence, compellence, and escalation management activities should be carefully examined.<br /><br />To that end, this white paper reviews Russian activities across the globe to build an enhanced, fundamental understanding of the contemporary and future influence environment. Countering Russian provocative activities requires a comprehensive strategy and the NDS recognizes this fact in order to successfully counter Russian provocative activities; as a result, the US must collaboratively employ multiple instruments of national power in a synchronized manner. As white paper contributor Brig Gen (ret) Rob Spalding III suggests, \u201cthe US role with regard to Russia should be to continue to engage European allies to take the lead for balancing in Europe. The allies\u2019 goal should be deterrence. At the same time, the US should bilaterally engage Russia to peel them away from China\u2019s orbit. The US can work with Russia in ways that improve the US-Russia relationship without detracting from European efforts to balance and deter.\u201d<br /><br />The articles in this white paper provide government stakeholders\u2014intelligence, law enforcement, military, and policy agencies\u2014with valuable insights and analytic frameworks to assist the US, its allies, and partners in developing a comprehensive strategy to compete and defeat this Russian challenge. Significant observations include:<br /><br />\u2022 Russia is adopting coercive strategies that involve the orchestrated employment of military and nonmilitary means to deter and compel the US, its allies and partners prior to and after the outbreak of hostilities. These strategies must be proactively confronted, or the threat of significant armed conflict may increase.<br /><br />\u2022 Russia exhibits a deep-seated sense of geopolitical insecurity which motivates it to pursue strategic objectives that establish an uncontested sphere of influence in the post-Soviet region. Yet, Russians increasingly disagree with the Kremlin\u2019s assertions that the US is a looming external danger and a subversive force in Russian domestic politics.<br /><br />\u2022 Russia\u2019s gray zone tactics are most effective when the target is deeply polarized or lacks the capacity to resist and respond effectively to Russian aggression. According to Russian strategic thought, deterrence and compellence are two sides of the same coin.<br /><br />Only with a aligned and synchrozined whole of government approach will the US compete and win against emerging powers like Russia and China. Such collaboration requires a common understanding of our competitors, their tactics and desired endstates and we intend that this white paper will achieve this critical objective.<br /><br />This white paper was prepared as part of the Strategic Multilayer Asssessment, entitled The Future of Global Competition and Conflict. Twenty-three expert contributors contributed to this white paper and provided wide-ranging assessments of Russia\u2019s global interests and objectives, as well as the activities\u2014gray or otherwise\u2014that it conducts to achieve them. This white paper is divided into five sections and twenty-five chapters, as described below. This summary reports some of the white paper\u2019s high-level findings, but it is no substitute for a careful read of the individual contributions.<br /><br />There is broad consensus among the contributors that Russian President Vladimir Putin is indeed adhering to a global grand strategy, which aims to achieve the following goals:<br /><br />\u2022 Reclaim and secure Russia\u2019s influence over former Soviet nations<br /><br />\u2022 Regain worldwide recognition as a \u201cgreat power\u201d<br /><br />\u2022 Portray itself as a reliable actor, a key regional powerbroker, and a successful mediator (Katz; Borshchevskaya) in order to gain economic, military, and political influence over nations<br /><br />worldwide and to refine the liberalist rules and norms that currently govern the world order (Lamoreaux)<br /><br />According to Dr. Robert Person, these goals are motivated by Russia\u2019s deep-seated geopolitical insecurity. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia has struggled to find its place in the global community, which has left the leadership with a lingering desire to regain the influence and power that it once had. In particular, Russia seeks to regain its influence over former Soviet states, which it claims are in its rightful \u201csphere of influence\u201d (Lamoreaux; Person; Marsh). As a result, one of the United States\u2019 core goals, namely promoting and protecting the international liberal order, comes into contention with the goals of Russia\u2019s grand strategy. This underpins the Kremlin\u2019s belief that it must contain and constrain US influence and activities in Europe and elsewhere across the globe. As Ms. Anna Borshchevskaya\u2019s contribution suggests, the Russian leadership\u2019s worldview is zero-sum; it believes that in order for Russia to win, the US must lose. However, Dr. Christopher Marsh\u2019s contribution suggests that this world view is not necessarily shared by the Russian population or its elite.<br /><br />As evidenced by the range of \u201cgray zone\u201d activities it engages in, a number of the expert contributors argue that the Russian leadership sees itself as at war with the US and the West as a whole. From a Russian perspective, this war is not total, but rather, it is fundamental (Goure)\u2014a type of \u201cwar\u201d that is at odds with the general US understanding of warfare. Russia believes that there is no unacceptable or illegitimate form of deterrence, compellence, or escalation management (Goure). It also does not believe in the continuum of conflict that the US has constructed. Like Russia\u2019s perception of its competition with the US, its perception of conflict is dichotomous: one is either at war or not at war. To fight and win this war, Russia believes that the successful integration of all instruments of state power (Goure), as well as the orchestrated employment of non-military and military means to deter and compel (Flynn), are paramount. Furthermore, Russian military concepts include options for employing preemptive force to induce shock and dissuade an adversary from conducting military operations and to compel a de-escalation of hostilities (Flynn). The authors observe that Russia\u2019s strategies are continuously evolving and expect that the discrepancy between the Russian and the US understanding of \u201cconflict\u201d and \u201cwar\u201d will continue to grow, leading to a higher risk of escalation in future situations involving both nations.<br /><br />Overall, Russia\u2019s influence abroad is growing, and the Kremlin has mastered the use of \u201chybrid warfare\u201d in driving Russia\u2019s foreign policy (Lamoreaux). Russia utilizes a variety of gray zone tactics around the globe. These include the use of paramilitary forces and other proxies, interference in political processes, economic and energy exploitation (particularly in Africa), espionage, and media and propaganda manipulation. Putin is also adept at blending military and civilian elements for maximum impact (Weitz).<br /><br />The specific tactics of hybrid warfare that Russia uses vary by region. In Europe, for example, Russia has utilized propaganda, an increasing dependence on external energy resources, and political manipulation to achieve its primary goals (Schindler; Lamoreaux). In contrast, in the Middle East and Africa\u2014 important sources of minerals and other natural resources from a Russian perspective1\u2014Russia has primarily utilized economic exploitation tools (Katz; Borshchevskaya; Severin). In Central Asia, Russia maintains a much more limited presence, due to China\u2019s geographic proximity and the current levels of economic and security engagement by other regional actors (Kangas). Nevertheless, Russia does retain influence in the Central Asia, as a result of its historical, linguistic, and cultural connections to the region (Laruelle; Dyet). Likewise, in Latin America, Russia lacks a sufficient amount of deployable resources to fully implement its strategy or to extend its influence very far (Ellis). However, as Dr. Barnett S. Koven and Ms. Abigail C. Kamp observe, Russia makes up for its shortcomings by engaging in episodic and reactive endeavors to disrupt US influence in the region. Although Russian tactics vary significantly, in all regions of the world energy has been a key source of Russian power and influence (Weitz; Lamoreaux; Borshchevskaya; Devyatkin; Pyatkov; Werchan). Globally, many countries have developed a strong relationship with Russia when it comes to energy. Russia\u2019s energy priorities extend worldwide, and European nations in particular have become dependent on Russia for access to these resources. Africa and the Arctic have also become significant as Russia looks to exploit opportunities for energy-related commerce.<br /><br />Despite the strength of Russia\u2019s growing influence abroad and the diverse array of gray zone tactics it uses to achieve its strategic goals, the US can still limit the results of this grand strategy. There is broad consensus among the contributors that countering Russian provocations will require the use of all instruments of national power. In particular, US success will be reliant both on its ability to influence populations, states, and non-state actors, and on its ability to minimize Russia\u2019s influence on these actors (Bragg). Creating effective narratives in each of the regions covered in this white paper will be critical for achieving this goal (Kangas; Bragg). Furthermore, the US can counter specific Russian gray zone activities, such as diversifying energy sources to reduce European nations\u2019 dependence on Russia (Pyatkov; Werchan) and counteracting propaganda by creating both resilient democratic institutions and populations abroad, particularly in Europe (Pyatkov). Finally, it is imperative that the US establishes a consensus definition of \u201cgray zone\u201d (Bragg) and reevaluates old paradigms defining war and peace, as we enter a \u201cnew era of international politics which is defined by shades of gray\u201d (Weitz). Once defined, a federal agency dedicated to gray zone activities may be required in order to implement a true whole of government approach to combatting Russian influence activities abroad (Werchan).<br /><br />Share this:<br /><br />Related Material From the Archive:<br /><br />", "publish_time": 1569727533241, "collection_time": 1569727533242, "summary": "Understanding the future of global competition and conflict is now more important than ever before.

Drug investigators report that it is becoming more widespread, addicting abusers from middle school to middle age. Perhaps the most concerning threat related to pharmaceutical abuse is the alarmingly high potential for overdose or accidental death from controlled prescription drugs. In Harris County alone, from 2006 through 2008 pharmaceuticals were present in over 66% of the 1533 cases of toxicity-related deaths.1 In 2009, over 78% involved pharmaceuticals. Not only is diversion a deadly problem, it is incredibly profitable. Pain management clinic owners gross an average of $4,000-$5,000 per day at each location. A successful owner running multiple clinics can easily make $75,000 a week from only three operations, getting paid entirely in cash.<br /><br />Over the last few years, it has become more commonplace to see military-type weaponry such as grenades and assault rifles utilized by Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs). Increasingly, many of the reported hand grenade seizures in United States are illegal, improvised grenades destined for Mexico and the DTOs. These devices have become a weapon of choice for Mexican DTOs because they are cheap, the components are relatively easy to obtain and manufacture, are easily concealable, and can kill or injure large numbers of people indiscriminately. Reports have indicated that grenade attacks originated mostly in southern Mexico around the beginning of President Felipe Calderon\u2019s presidency in 2006, and have steadily spread northward as the conflicts between rival DTO cartels, and Mexican government\u2019s enforcement efforts have intensified in the northern Mexican Border States.<br /><br />On 02/23/2011 Khalid Ali\u2010M Aldawsari (pictured left), a Saudi national currently attending college at South Plains College, near Lubbock, Texas, was arrested on federal terrorism charges.

Court documents advise that Aldawsari had performed internet research on how to construct an IED, using chemical components. It has also been alleged he had acquired/taken major steps in acquiring the necessary components and equipment needed to build such a device.

It may require the use of tactical capabilities beyond those of the typical ICE enforcement officer in order to ensure the safe and successful resolution of the action. Under these circumstances, Tactical Teams possessing specialized skills, specialized equipment and specialized training to meet these particular challenges may be required. The deployment of these teams can be viewed as the use of an elevated level of force.  For these reasons, it is important for ICE to have processes and procedures for the establishment and operation of these teams, appropriate training and qualification standards for team members, and very specific reporting requirements through defined reporting channels, for team activities.<br /><br />The SM-CCTV System is a computer network consisting of closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders (DVRs), and monitoring capabilities that capture video-only feeds in and around ICE facilities. The purpose of the SM-CCTV System is to help ICE secure and regulate physical access to ICE facilities. The system also serves to enhance officer safety, prevent crimes, and assist in the investigation of criminal acts committed inside and on the perimeter of protected ICE facilities. Video surveillance also supports terrorism prevention and facility protection with its visible presence, and detects and deters unauthorized intrusion at ICE facilities. The SM-CCTV System is planned to be deployed in numerous ICE facilities nationwide.<br /><br />The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General issued a report in May 2011 titled Supervision of Aliens Commensurate with Risk that details Immigration and Customs Enforcements (ICE) detention and supervision of aliens.  The report  includes a list of Specially Designated Countries (SDCs) that are said to promote, produce, or protect terrorist organizations or their members.  The report states that ICE uses a Third Agency Check (TAC) to screen aliens from specially designated countries (SDCs) that have shown a tendency to promote, produce, or protect terrorist organizations or their members and that the purpose of the additional screening is to determine whether other agencies have an interest in the alien. ICE\u2019s policy requires officers to conduct TAC screenings only for aliens from SDCs if the aliens are in ICE custody.<br /><br />The ICE Pattern Analysis and Information Collection (ICEPIC) system was established in 2008 to enable ICE law enforcement agents and analysts to look for non-obvious relationship patterns among individuals and organizations that are indicative of violations of the customs and immigration laws that are enforced by DHS agencies, as well as possible terrorist threats and plots. From these relationships, ICE agents develop specific leads and intelligence for active and new investigations. Identified relationships are also recorded for reuse in subsequent investigative analyses.

It may require the use of tactical capabilities beyond those of the typical ICE enforcement officer in order to ensure the safe and successful resolution of the action. Under these circumstances, Tactical Teams possessing specialized skills, specialized equipment and specialized training to meet these particular challenges may be required. The deployment of these teams can be viewed as the use of an elevated level of force.  For these reasons, it is important for ICE to have processes and procedures for the establishment and operation of these teams, appropriate training and qualification standards for team members, and very specific reporting requirements through defined reporting channels, for team activities.<br /><br />The SM-CCTV System is a computer network consisting of closed-circuit video cameras, digital video recorders (DVRs), and monitoring capabilities that capture video-only feeds in and around ICE facilities. The purpose of the SM-CCTV System is to help ICE secure and regulate physical access to ICE facilities. The system also serves to enhance officer safety, prevent crimes, and assist in the investigation of criminal acts committed inside and on the perimeter of protected ICE facilities. Video surveillance also supports terrorism prevention and facility protection with its visible presence, and detects and deters unauthorized intrusion at ICE facilities. The SM-CCTV System is planned to be deployed in numerous ICE facilities nationwide.<br /><br />The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General issued a report in May 2011 titled Supervision of Aliens Commensurate with Risk that details Immigration and Customs Enforcements (ICE) detention and supervision of aliens.  The report  includes a list of Specially Designated Countries (SDCs) that are said to promote, produce, or protect terrorist organizations or their members.  The report states that ICE uses a Third Agency Check (TAC) to screen aliens from specially designated countries (SDCs) that have shown a tendency to promote, produce, or protect terrorist organizations or their members and that the purpose of the additional screening is to determine whether other agencies have an interest in the alien. ICE\u2019s policy requires officers to conduct TAC screenings only for aliens from SDCs if the aliens are in ICE custody.<br /><br />The ICE Pattern Analysis and Information Collection (ICEPIC) system was established in 2008 to enable ICE law enforcement agents and analysts to look for non-obvious relationship patterns among individuals and organizations that are indicative of violations of the customs and immigration laws that are enforced by DHS agencies, as well as possible terrorist threats and plots. From these relationships, ICE agents develop specific leads and intelligence for active and new investigations. Identified relationships are also recorded for reuse in subsequent investigative analyses. The information processed by ICEPIC comes from existing ICE investigative and apprehension records systems, as well as immigration and alien admission records systems. ICEPIC includes capabilities that assist investigators in recording results of analyses performed in support of investigations and in capturing additional relevant information obtained from outside sources.

The men stated that she was the wife of a US interrogator. When she denied their claims, the men laughed. The two men left the area in a dark-colored, four-door sedan with two other Middle-Eastern males in the vehicle. The woman had observed the vehicle in the neighborhood on previous occasions.<br /><br />,The Colorado Information Analysis Center (CIAC) is disseminating this awareness bulletin to help law enforcement officers and military personnel to minimize their social media footprint and protect their identity and family. Recent calls for attacks against law enforcement officers by foreign terrorist organizations and recent reports released by the U.S. Senate Select Intelligence Committee\u2019s report on the CIA\u2019s Detention Interrogation Program may exacerbate tensions or even spark violence against officers, intelligence personnel, government officials, and their families. This awareness bulletin seeks to make general recommendations to limit an individual\u2019s digital footprint and diminish a violent actor\u2019s targeting capability.<br /><br />,This document is intended to provide first responders with a summary of current information about the Ebola virus as well as provide awareness on safety guidelines for first responders. First responders are defined as law enforcement, fire service, and emergency medical service professionals.<br /><br />,The Knox-Box\u00ae rapid entry system is an access control system utilized by public safety agencies. This system allows facilities to securely store entry keys or cards on site for first responders. First responders utilize a master key that unlocks all Knox boxes within their jurisdiction.  Currently there are over 3.5 million Knox-Box rapid entry systems in use nationwide and over 11,500 fire departments in North America that use the Knox-Box rapid entry system. In one Colorado fire district there are over 4,000 Knox-Box systems in use within the local, state, and federal government which includes; energy, water, postal, emergency services, defense, transportation, and communication sectors.  Unauthorized access to the system would allow individuals to bypass physical security measures at the site. The unauthorized individuals would also be able to duplicate keys, or remove entry keys or cards which would delay first responders.<br /><br />,The State of Colorado legalized medical marijuana in 2012 and recreational marijuana in 2014. There has been an increased amount of marijuana infused products sold to the public. The products range from fruit chewz, gummiez, cupcakes, truffles, rice krispy treats, butter, and banana bread. It is extremely difficult to differentiate between marijuana infused products and non-infused products if the original packaging is not with the product.<br /><br />,The Colorado Information Analysis Center (CIAC) is disseminating this bulletin to assist with first responder awareness when dealing with calls for service involving hash oil production.<br /><br />, , , , ,International terrorist groups and violent extremists have long shown interest in using fire as a weapon due to the low cost and limited technical expertise required, the potential for causing large-scale damage, and the low risk of apprehension. Recent encouragement of use of this tactic by terrorist groups and violent extremists in propaganda materials and extremist Web forums is directed at Western audiences and supports Homeland attacks.<br /><br />,The Colorado Information Analysis Center (CIAC) has no current information indicating an imminent threat to Colorado chemical sector critical infrastructure. However, both within the United States and abroad, recent attempts to perpetrate attacks utilizing the Postal and Shipping and Transportation Sectors has created a need for heightened awareness. The CIAC has produced this assessment to provide situational awareness on the current critical infrastructure threat environment, sector incidents and trends, as well as pertinent updates. Information contained in this report originates from CIAC cases, unclassified local, state, and federal databases, and open source reporting.<br /><br />,On 29 October the Colorado Information Analysis Center received notification from Tri-County Health Department regarding several instances of an individual posing as a health inspector.  An individual posing as a \u201cHealth Department\u201d inspector has called businesses in Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas, and Larimer counties to set up a meeting to inspect their facilities. However, once scheduled the individual does not show up. The CIAC is aware of similar incidents in Orange County, CA in June 2010. Although Orange County does not use the 760 area code seen in the above incidents, it is possible that these similar reports indicate a trend that crosses state lines. The \u201cinspectors\u201d in Orange County used the same MO as in the Colorado cases. In other states, these types of imposters have extorted money from food facility operators, although this type of activity has not been reported in Colorado.<br /><br />,Smartphones feature an diverse array of computer capabilities which expose them to many of the vulnerabilities previously confined to computers. These threats have evolved from targeting personal computers (PCs) to hitting smartphones much quicker than some security experts anticipated. It took almost fifteen years for these types of attacks to evolve for PCs, but these attacks have been adapted for smartphones much more quickly. The malicious software (malware) currently targeting smartphones attempts to gather personal information stored on the phone and sell it. Since users often store more of this type of information on smartphones than PCs, in some cases it has become more profitable for hackers to create malware for smartphones than PCs.<br /><br />,Terrorist operations are most likely to be disrupted during the extensive planning phase.

The video addresses the group\u2019s territorial defeat in Syria, discusses the acceptance of pledges of allegiance from ISIS supporters, and praises recent attacks in Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia. This JIB is provided by the FBI, DHS, and NCTC to support their respective activities and to assist federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government counterterrorism and law enforcement officials and private sector security partners in deterring, preventing, or disrupting terrorist attacks against the United States. All video details described in this JIB are taken from the translated transcript of Baghdadi\u2019s speech.<br /><br />We assess that a Shia homegrown violent extremist (HVE) attack in the US is highly unlikely absent a catalyzing event that could galvanize some US-based Shia to engage independently in violence. Given sustained bilateral US-Iran tensions, the occurrence of such a catalyst could prompt Shia HVE activity relatively quickly, underscoring the benefits of early engagement with Shia communities about indicators of HVE radicalization. Potential triggering events for such Shia HVE violence include US military action against Iran and Lebanese Hizballah, Shia leadership or senior clerics sanctioning violence in the US, prominent Sunni government attacks on Shia, or high-profile anti-Shia activity in the US, judging from the results of a structured NCTC brainstorming exercise.<br /><br />NCTC assesses that the Sunni extremist threat to the US before 9/11 was characterized by diverse extremist organizations and lone actors motivated by multiple ideological narratives and other factors, including Salafi jihadism, Palestinian nationalism, theological disputes within Islam, anti-Semitism, and anti-Hindu sentiments. We have identified a dozen successful attacks, four disrupted plots, and one attempt to set up an extremist training camp in the US between 1973 and 2001, underscoring the persistent threat from al-Qa\u2018ida\u2013associated extremists, Palestinian terrorist groups, and Sunni extremist lone actors in the decades leading up to 9/11. These extremists chose a wide array of targets, with the majority of their attacks before 1993 focused on Hindu, Jewish, or Muslim individuals or institutions. Most attacks after that date were against civilian or US Government targets, because of al-Qa\u2018ida\u2013associated extremists\u2019 focus on indiscriminate mass casualty attacks. In some cases, we lack clear insight into the attackers\u2019 motivations because of information gaps, and FBI disagrees about the motivations underlying two of these attacks.<br /><br />, ,This Joint Intelligence Bulletin (JIB) is intended to provide information on Australian national and violent extremist Brenton Tarrant\u2019s 15 March 2019 attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. These attacks underscore the enduring nature of violent threats posed to faith-based communities. FBI, DHS, and NCTC advise federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government counterterrorism and law enforcement officials and private sector security partners responsible for securing faith-based communities in the Homeland to remain vigilant in light of the enduring threat to faith-based communities posed by domestic extremists (DEs), as well as by homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) who may seek retaliation.<br /><br />Counterterrorism Weekly is an UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY compilation of open source publicly available press and relevant commentary on issues related to terrorism and counterterrorism over the past seven days. It is produced every Wednesday, excluding holidays. Counterterrorism Weekly is produced by the National Counterterrorism Center and contains situational awareness items detailing ongoing terrorism-related developments which may be of interest to Federal, State, Local and Tribal Law Enforcement, security, military personnel, and first responders. Information contained in the Counterterrorism Weekly is subject to change as a situation further develops.<br /><br />, ,The late 2016 arrest of two California teenagers for allegedly planning a \u201cmass casualty event\u201d by carrying out a chemical attack at a local high school pep rally highlights how individuals can use online resources to plan crude chemical or biological attacks. Violent extremists continue to circulate often ineffective or misleading how-to instructions for producing and disseminating poisons, crude biological toxins, and toxic industrial chemicals that in many cases are commercially available and easy to obtain. While we have no indication the suspects in this case subscribed to or consumed material related to violent extremist ideologies, their activity highlights one path to conducting a potential chemical or biological attack.<br /><br />, ,There is continued terrorist interest in attacking the rail system either as the primary target or as an attack mechanism. The US railroad system includes 800 railroads, 144,000 miles of track, and 212,000 railroad crossings. First responders should work closely with railroad police departments and other security partners to better protect rail assets\u2014including freight rail (railcars loaded with commodities or hazardous materials), passenger rail (Amtrak, regional, or commuter rail), heavy rail (metro, and subway), and light rail (street cars, tramways, or trolleys)\u2014from terrorist attacks and criminal activities. This product was developed to provide general rail safety tips and resources to help increase first responder awareness of the rail environment.<br /><br />, ,Food and agriculture infrastructure is a $1 trillion industry, almost entirely under private ownership and comprises an estimated 2.1 million farms, 935,000 restaurants, and more than 200,000 registered food manufacturing, processing, and storage facilities. Intentional contamination of the food supply could have significant public health and economic consequences depending on the commodity, the agent used, and where in the supply chain the contaminant was added. This product provides first responders and private-sector stakeholders an awareness of the complex operating environment that may result from intentional contamination of the food supply and identifies key collaborative partners and indicators to minimize the risk of an intentional attack on the food supply.<br /><br />NCTC assesses that the Sunni violent extremist threat in the US has evolved from one defined by complex, large-scale attacks directed by a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) to mostly self-initiated attacks by homegrown violent extremists using relatively simple methods. Of the 28 Sunni violent extremist attacks in the US since 9/11 only three were directed by an FTO. Most attacks were perpetrated by individuals enabled\u2014through encouragement or operational support\u2014or inspired by ISIS, al-Qa\u2018ida, and al-Qa\u2018ida affiliates.<br /><br />, ,The number of criminal and gang-related assaults involving acid or other corrosive substances has risen sharply in some Western countries. As of July 2017, police statistics in England indicate assaults and threats involving corrosives have risen from 183 in 2012 to more than 500 this year, according to open source reporting. Although there has been minimal specific interest by terrorists in acid attacks to date, we judge the increase in criminal incidents coupled with recent English-language terrorist messaging encouraging attacks using acid may spur opportunistic terrorist use of the tactic, underscoring the potential threat and importance of an immediate on-scene emergency response.<br /><br />In August, ISIS released a seven-minute, English-language video encouraging would-be fighters to travel to the Philippines instead of Syria and Iraq. The video was the latest sign the group has shifted its recruiting tactics as it loses ground to Coalition Forces in the Middle East. Asia has become a new focus for ISIS, according to private sector analysts, such as Flashpoint Intelligence.<br /><br />, ,This case study is an examination of behaviors that resulted in a disrupted terrorist attack, revealing a cycle of planning and preparation that could provide indicators for preventing similar attempts. The terrorist attack planning cycle is not a static, linear process but rather could begin in any of the several stages with variances in details, sequence, and timing. An individual\u2019s mobilization to violence often provides observable behavioral indicators such as, pre-attack surveillance, training, and rehearsal. The indicators potentially allow third-party observers and law enforcement to identify individuals moving to violence, circumstances that may allow for disruption of planned attacks. This product is intended to cultivate an awareness of the planning cycle among stakeholders for identification, mitigation, and disruption of attack planning.<br /><br />, ,The Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) is attempting to obtain money from organ harvesting, including from its own injured members, captives, and deceased individuals. Identification, prevention, and interdiction of organ harvesting and trafficking is a highly complex issue which may be effectively addressed through international partnerships among governmental, health, law enforcement, legal, and private-sector entities.<br /><br />, ,We assess with moderate confidence that cyber actors, including those who support violent extremism, are likely to continue targeting first responders on the World Wide Web, including by distributing personally identifiable information (PII) for the purpose of soliciting attacks from willing sympathizers in the homeland, hacking government websites, or attacking 911 phone systems to hinder first responders\u2019 ability to respond to crises.<br /><br />The indicators of violent extremist mobilization described herein are intended to provide federal, state, local, territorial and tribal law enforcement a roadmap of observable behaviors that could inform whether individuals or groups are preparing to engage in violent extremist activities including potential travel overseas to join a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). The indicators are grouped by their assessed levels of diagnosticity\u2014meaning how clearly we judge the behavior demonstrates an individual\u2019s trajectory towards terrorist activity.<br /><br />, ,Recent calls over the past year for attacks on hospitals in the West by media outlets sympathetic to the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) highlight terrorists\u2019 perception of hospitals as viable targets for attack. Targeting hospitals and healthcare facilities is consistent with ISIS\u2019s tactics in Iraq and Syria, its previous calls for attacks on hospitals in the West, and the group\u2019s calls for attacks in the West using \u201call available means.\u201d While we have not seen any specific, credible threat against hospitals and healthcare facilities in the United States, we remain concerned that calls for such attacks may resonate with some violent extremists and lone offenders in the Homeland because of their likely perceived vulnerabilities and value as targets.<br /><br />, ,This Joint Intelligence Bulletin (JIB) is intended to provide new insight into the targeting preferences of some homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) and to examine detection challenges and opportunities.

The explosion killed more than 100 people and wounded approximately 235 others. According to the deputy spokesperson for the Afghanistan Interior Ministry, the vehicle was painted to resemble an ambulance and had successfully passed through a checkpoint after the attacker allegedly told police he was transporting a patient to a nearby hospital. While stopped at a second checkpoint farther inside the city limits, the attacker detonated the explosives concealed in the vehicle.<br /><br />,On 11 July, the United States Government removed Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab from two lists of approved vendors used by government agencies to purchase technology equipment, amid concerns the cyber security firms products could be used by the Kremlin to gain entry into U.S. networks. Last month the Senate Armed Services Committee passed a defense spending policy bill that would ban Kaspersky products from use in the military. The move came a day after the FBI interviewed several of the companys U.S. employees at their private homes as part of a counterintelligence investigation into its operations.<br /><br />,During a recent lawful protest in Orange County, local law enforcement officers discovered various improvised weapons in the possession of protesters or concealed and placed in the vicinity of the protest.<br /><br />,The Orange County Intelligence Assessment Center (OCIAC) has received reporting indicating cybercriminals are manipulating e-mail filters as a means to monitor and divert e-mail communications.<br /><br />On December 2, 2015 at about 10:58 am San Bernardino Police began to receive numerous calls of shots fired at the Inland Regional Center located at 1365 South Waterman Avenue in San Bernardino. Initial calls indicated that there were several gunshots heard. Another call reported that there were two or possibly three subjects in all black clothing and masks armed with assault weapons. Within a matter of three to four minutes there were multiple calls reporting that multiple masked subjects had entered in the conference room, located in Building 3 of the Inland Regional Center, and opened fire in the main conference room.<br /><br />,Use of vehicles by violent extremists for ramming attacks has increased steadily, while use of vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) remains rare outside the Middle East. Given the ease with which ramming attacks can be accomplished, it is likely use of this tactic will continue to rise. Unlike VBIEDs, ramming attacks require little specialized training or skill, present minimal risk of detection when acquiring the weapon, and offer flexibility with regard to preparation, timing, and target. Foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs) have pointedly encouraged use of vehicle ramming attacks, offering explicit tactical advice on vehicle selection, driving tips to maximize fatalities, and targeting suggestions that include parades, festivals, street fairs, outdoor markets or conventions, political rallies, and other crowded targets of opportunity.<br /><br />California has had more disclosed unauthorized Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) encounters than any other state between October 2015 and September 2016\u2014accounting for 21 percent of the reported encounters nationwide\u2014according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). These encounters continue to pose a direct risk to public safety air assets.<br /><br />,The results of this analysis show a strong earthquake will likely cause significant damage to critical infrastructure in the area affecting 547 dams or water control structures, render approximately 300 roadway segments unusable, and cause damage to 172 water and wastewater treatment systems. The scenario earthquake will likely cause damage to 154 dams in the area. Seven of the dams will likely experience Extensive or Complete damage. The Ward Creek Dam, which is used for flood control, is likely to incur Complete damage. Extensive damage to the James H. Turner Dam poses the greatest risk to downstream population. The earthquake will cause damages to many road segments, bridges, and tunnels in the area. As a result, travel times on these roadways and others will increase significantly. Multiple areas on freeways such as I\u2013680, I\u2013880, and I\u2013580 will have the highest above normal traffic volumes. Several bridges on these freeways will also likely incur Extensive damage.

As certain tattoos sported by Mexican Mafia members and supporters become mainstream, and because California Department of Corrections is known to use certain tattoos as validation points, Mexican Mafia members may introduce new tattoos to make it difficult for law enforcement and correctional officers to identify membership or affiliation with the group. Tattoos are also increasingly disguised within other tattoos, which can make them more difficult to easily identify.<br /><br />The Joint City-Port Domain Awareness Center (interchangeably referred to in this document as \u201cJoint City-Port Domain Awareness Center\u201d, \u201cDomain Awareness Center,\u201d or \u201cDAC\u201d) was first proposed to the City Council\u2019s Public Safety Committee on June 18, 2009, in an information report regarding the City of Oakland partnering with the Port of Oakland to apply for Port Security Grant funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, 2009. Under this grant program, funding was available for Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) projects relative to \u201cmaritime\u201d or \u201cwaterside\u201d. The Port and City were encouraged to consider the development of a joint City Port Domain Awareness Center.

The documents concern the Oakland Police Department response to protests against the 2013 Urban Shield homeland security exercise held in Alameda County.  Urban Shield is an annual exercise series that features nearly fifty different training scenarios for law enforcement ranging from terrorist attacks conducted by homegrown extremists to hostage situations, fires and even natural disasters.  The 2013 Urban Shield exercise involved dozens of federal, state and local law enforcement organizations, representatives of foreign countries such as Switzerland, Brazil, Bahrain, Jordan, as well as more than a dozen corporations including FedEx, Cisco Systems and Verizon Wireless.  The documents are heavily redacted and include an operations plan, a presentation on Occupy Oakland, arrest reports and other miscellaneous documentation related to the protests.<br /><br />,Hundreds of emails from the City of Oakland relating to the construction of the City/Port of Oakland Joint Domain Awareness Center.  The files were scanned from printouts held in a series of folders by the City of Oakland and were obtained via a public records request made by members of Occupy Oakland.  The emails were the source material for a recent story in the East Bay Express by Darwin BondGraham stating that the City of Oakland had allowed the Domain Awareness Centers prime contractor Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) to perjure themselves by signing a disclosure form claiming that the company was in compliance with the citys Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Ordinance which prohibits the city from doing business with contractors that are connected to the production or use of nuclear weapons.

The PLA calls this theory of victory systems attack and destruction warfare, hereafter, system attack. Authoritative PLA doctrine emphasizes importance of system attack as Chinas basic operational method of warfare. System attack is perhaps best remembered as the American way of war with Chinese characteristics, since the PLA developed the concept based on observing U.S. military victories In the 1990s. Some of the PLAs writings on systems attack are clearly aspirational, but this does not preclude the effectiveness of the approach, and the doctrine shows that the Pl.A is thinking seriously and realistically about how to defeat.an advanced adversary. The requirements of system attack are actively driving PLA reform, acquisitions, operations and training, and the doctrine telegraphs how Chine intends to fight.<br /><br />All modern forces depend on the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). The military requirement for unimpeded access to, and use of, the EMS is the key focus for joint electromagnetic spectrum operations (JEMSO), both in support of military operations and as the focus of operations themselves. Electronic warfare (EW) is essential for protecting friendly operations and denying adversary operations within the EMS throughout the operational environment.<br /><br />,This white paper was prepared as part of the Strategic Multilayer Asssessment, entitled The Future of Global Competition and Conflict. Twenty-three expert contributors contributed to this white paper and provided wide-ranging assessments of Russia\u2019s global interests and objectives, as well as the activities\u2014gray or otherwise\u2014that it conducts to achieve them. This white paper is divided into five sections and twenty-five chapters, as described below. This summary reports some of the white paper\u2019s high-level findings, but it is no substitute for a careful read of the individual contributions.<br /><br />Commanders ensure operational security (OPSEC) is practiced during all phases of operations. OPSEC is a capability that identifies and controls critical information, indicators of friendly force actions attendant to military operations, and incorporates countermeasures to reduce the risk of an adversary exploiting vulnerabilities. As adversary analysts apply more information to an analytical model, the likelihood increases that the analytical model will replicate the observed force. Thus, current and future capabilities and courses of action can be revealed and compromised.<br /><br />Peace operations are activities intended to build, keep, enforce, or make peace, or when necessary, prevent conflict. They include crisis response and limited contingency operations and frequently involve international military missions to contain conflict, restore peace, and shape the strategic security environment to support reconciliation and rebuilding, as well as to facilitate the transition to legitimate governance. They include peacekeeping operations (PKO), peace building, peacemaking, conflict prevention, and peace enforcement operations (PEO). Peace operations may be conducted under the sponsorship of the United Nations (UN), another international organization, within a coalition of nations, or unilaterally.<br /><br />Nuclear weapons are a key feature of the security environment. Adversaries increasingly rely on nuclear weapons to secure their interests. Those seeking ways to use nuclear weapons for coercion and war termination present complex deterrence and escalation management challenges. US nuclear weapons and the associated capabilities needed to conduct nuclear operations are essential to ensure an effective deterrent.<br /><br />This policy memorandum provides guidance for the domestic1 use of Department of Defense (DoD) unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in U.S. National Airspace to ensure that such use is in accordance with U.S. law and DoD policy. Policy Memorandum 15-002, Guidance for the Domestic Use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems, February 17, 2015 is hereby rescinded. This guidance implements measures identified in DoDs efficiency and effectiveness review of domestic use of DoD UAS. The revisions in this memorandum streamline the approval process for domestic use.<br /><br />DODD 5100.01 tasks the Army to \u201ctrain and equip, as required, forces for airborne operations, in coordination with the other military Services, and in accordance with joint doctrine.\u201d This guidance directs the Army, which has primary responsibility for the development of airborne doctrine, procedures, and techniques, to develop, in coordination with the other military Services, doctrine, procedures, and equipment that are of common interest.<br /><br />Robotic and Autonomous Systems (RAS) and artificial intelligence (AI) are fundamental to the future Joint Force realizing the full potential of Multi-Domain Operations (MDO 1.5). These systems, in particular AI, offer the ability to outmaneuver adversaries across domains, the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, and the information environment. The employment of these systems during competition allows the Joint Force to understand the operational environment (OE) in real time, and thus better employ both manned and unmanned capabilities to defeat threat operations meant to destabilize a region, deter escalation of violence, and turn denied spaces into contested spaces. In the transition from competition to armed conflict, RAS and AI maneuver, fires, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities provide the Joint Force with the ability to deny the enemy\u2019s efforts to seize positions of advantage.<br /><br />The idea of invisibility has fascinated people for millennia, inspiring many myths, novels, and films. Invisibility cloaking has recently become a subject of science and technology. This paper describes the important current theoretical and experimental developments and tries to project into the future.<br /><br />From Multi-Domain Battle to Multi-Domain Operations. TRADOC Pamphlet 525-3-1, The U.S. Army in Multi-Domain Operations 2028 expands upon the ideas previously explained in Multi-Domain Battle: Evolution of Combined Arms for the 21st Century. It describes how the Army contributes to the Joint Force\u2019s principal task as defined in the unclassified Summary of the National Defense Strategy: deter and defeat Chinese and Russian aggression in both competition and conflict. The U.S. Army in Multi-Domain Operations concept proposes detailed solutions to the specific problems posed by the militaries of post-industrial, information-based states like China and Russia. Although this concept focuses on China and Russia, the ideas also apply to other threats.<br /><br />The Domestic Operational Law (DOPLAW) Handbook for judge advocates is a product of the Center for Law and Military Operations (CLAMO).

FM 3-14 links Army space operations doctrine to joint space operations doctrine as expressed in JP 3-14, Space Operations and other joint doctrinal publications. This FM establishes guidance for employing space and space-based systems and capabilities to support United States (U.S.) Army land warfighting dominance. It provides a general overview of overhead support to Army operations, reviews national guidance and direction, and outlines selected unique space-related Army capabilities. The doctrine in this manual documents Army thought for the best use of space capabilities. This manual also contains tactics and procedures outlining how to plan, integrate, and execute Army space operations.<br /><br />Cyberspace operations (CO) is the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace. This publication focuses on military operations in and through cyberspace; explains the relationships and responsibilities of the Joint Staff (JS), combatant commands (CCMDs), United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), the Service cyberspace component (SCC) commands, and combat support agencies; and establishes a framework for the employment of cyberspace forces and capabilities.<br /><br />The Department of Defense (DoD) performs forensic science in a collaborative environment which necessitates the clear communication of all activities and their results. A critical enabler of communication is the use of a clear, internally consistent vocabulary. The goal of the Department of Defense Forensics Lexicon is to provide an operational vocabulary to address Forensics. A shared vocabulary enables a common understanding of Forensics, enhances the fidelity and the utility of operational reporting, facilitates structured data sharing, and strengthens the decision making processes across the DoD.<br /><br />If one is to realistically entertain the notion of interstellar exploration in timeframes of \u0430 human lifespan, \u0430 dramatic shift in the traditional approach to spacecraft propulsion is necessary.

With the 2008 military incursion into Georgia and the 2014 seizure of Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, Russia has assumed a more aggressive, interventionist stance in Europe. In the effort to influence events in Ukraine, the Russians have used what the US Army defines as \u201cHybrid Warfare\u201d to infiltrate, isolate, and dominate eastern Ukraine and Crimea. This is all a part of the strategy of what can be called \u201cIndirect Action\u201d\u2014the belief by the Russians that they reserve the right to protect ethnic Russians and interests in their former states from domination by Western powers and NATO.<br /><br />The report describes characteristics of 209 Americans who committed espionage-related offenses against the U.S. since 1947. Three cohorts are compared based on when the individual began espionage: 1947-1979, 1980-1989, and 1990-2015. Using data coded from open published sources, analyses are reported on personal attributes of persons across the three cohorts, the employment and levels of clearance, how they committed espionage, the consequences they suffered, and their motivations. The second part of the report explores each of the five types of espionage committed by the 209 persons under study. These include: classic espionage, leaks, acting as an agent of a foreign government, violations of export control laws, and economic espionage. The statutes governing each type are discussed and compared. Classification of national security information is discussed as one element in espionage. In Part 3, revisions to the espionage statutes are recommended in light of findings presented in the report.<br /><br />On January 27th, the President directed the Department of Defense to conduct a new Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) to ensure a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent that safeguards the homeland, assures allies, and deters adversaries. This review comes at a critical moment in our nations history, for America confronts an international security situation that is more Complex and demanding than any since the end of the Cold War. In this environment, it is not possible to delay modernization of our nuclear forces and remain faithful sentinels Of our nation s security and freedom for the next generation as well as our own.<br /><br />In the summer of 2012, HQDA G3 provided a presentation to the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA) focused on small arms overmatch at the squad level. This presentation resulted in questions raised by the CSA regarding the nature of the Army\u2019s holistic strategy for small arms dominance into the future. HQDA G3 received the task to follow up on these questions and present back to the CSA a comprehensive small arms strategy. In support of the HQDA G3 mission, ASA(ALT) SAAL-ZT as the responsible agent for the Army\u2019s science and technology investments, agreed to identify and prioritize future concepts with potential to enable long-term small arms overmatch for US military forces from the period 2020-2040+.<br /><br />Page 1 of 351<br /><br />&hellip;\ufeffSearch for:<br /><br />Follow UsA D V E R T I S E M E N T<br /><br />Categories&bull;", "publish_time": 1569727464180, "collection_time": 1569727464181, "summary": "", "source": "publicintelligence"}

It is responsible for the collection and analysis of foreign communications and foreign signals intelligence. For NSA/CSS to continue to lead the Intelligence Community into the next 50 years with state-of-the-art technologies and productivity, its mission elements will require new facilities and infrastructure.<br /><br />,With internet traffic growing exponentially, attacks on government and commercial computers by cyber terrorists and rogue states have escalated. Those wishing harm have espionage programs targeting the data systems used by the United States and allies. Drug traffickers and weapons dealers use the internet with encrypted communications. To counter these activities, the National Security Agency, an agency of the U.S. government, is building a fortified data center deep inside a mountain in Utah. This complex will house the world\u2019s most sophisticated supercomputers dedicated to code breaking and data traffic analysis.

Rather than using direct point-to-point communication to stay in touch (e.g., face-toface, phone, text/video messages), SNSs allow users to publish information that can be read later by other users (a one-to-many form of communication) and follow their friends postings and provide comments. SNSs provide innovative methods for interacting with friends through third-part applications, such as simple games (tic-tac-toe, paper-rock-scissors), interactive maps to show places visited across the world, and quiz/trivia games which allow for score comparison with others. Many SNSs also allow users to logon from mobile devices that have web browser access to the Internet, allowing them to check and update their accounts from virtually any location with a Wi-Fi or cellular signal.<br /><br />Two pamphlets produced by the NSA on Using Your BlackBerry Securely and Security Tips for Personally Managed Apple iPhones and iPads from March 2011.<br /><br />National Security Agency Site M Expansion Development Plan and Anti-Terrorism Force Protection Assessment from May 31, 2011.

Rather than using direct point-to-point communication to stay in touch (e.g., face-toface, phone, text/video messages), SNSs allow users to publish information that can be read later by other users (a one-to-many form of communication) and follow their friends postings and provide comments. SNSs provide innovative methods for interacting with friends through third-part applications, such as simple games (tic-tac-toe, paper-rock-scissors), interactive maps to show places visited across the world, and quiz/trivia games which allow for score comparison with others. Many SNSs also allow users to logon from mobile devices that have web browser access to the Internet, allowing them to check and update their accounts from virtually any location with a Wi-Fi or cellular signal.<br /><br />Two pamphlets produced by the NSA on Using Your BlackBerry Securely and Security Tips for Personally Managed Apple iPhones and iPads from March 2011.<br /><br />National Security Agency Site M Expansion Development Plan and Anti-Terrorism Force Protection Assessment from May 31, 2011.

In addition to targeting corporate information, vulnerable devices may be targeted for compromise for use in botnets or other criminal activities. The types of devices targeted include: Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phones, video conferencing equipment, conference phones, VoIP routers, and cloud-based communication systems. While cyber actors have targeted VoIP and other communication devices in the past, the FBI continues to see these devices scanned by cyber actors for vulnerabilities.<br /><br />ThreatSpecifically, the FBI observed cyber actors identifying and probing communication devices by issuing HTTP GET requestsa to a business server or network to retrieve device configuration files. Information contained in configuration files often reveals IP addresses, usernames, passwords, system management URLs, and assigned phone numbers \u2013 all of which could be used by cyber actors for malicious purposes. Many of the requests are specific to particular brands of devices. Victims will often receive several GET requests in succession with the actors scanning for multiple brands of devices.<br /><br />In addition, cyber actors retrieve IP addresses for further exploitation by using businesses customer service VoIP hyperlinks, which are traditionally made available for customers to use in contacting the business. Once those hyperlinked calls are answered, the actor retrieves the IP address belonging to the phone which answered the call. Once the IP address is retrieved, an actor could send a large volume of packets to the IP address, overloading it and taking the service offline for the targeted business and its legitimate customers.<br /><br />In addition to the above techniques, cyber actors target devices with brute-force attacks, attempting unauthorized access through the use of common usernames and passwords. Open source scanning tools can also be used to identify vulnerable communication devices and any associated ports.<br /><br />All of the information obtained through scans and other methods are likely used for specific targeting efforts by cyber actors. This includes leveraging access to compromised audio and video devices to eavesdrop on meetings or conference calls, placing fraudulent international phone calls, leveraging the compromised device for use in botnets, and conducting man-in-the-middle attacks to redirect corporate network traffic.<br /><br />Recommendations<br /><br />The following recommendations may limit the success of these types of attacks:<br /><br />Conduct daily server log reviews to identify unusual activity, including GET and POST requests from external IP addresses.<br /><br />Work with the communication device/system providers to ensure servers are patched and updated regularly.<br /><br />Consider restricting access to configuration files or configuring firewalls to block traffic from unauthorized IP addresses.<br /><br />Restrict communication devices/systems to only non-sensitive business networks.<br /><br />Conduct regular penetration testing exercises on communication devices to identify and address vulnerabilities in a timely matter.<br /><br />Enable encryption on teleconference programs and applications and consider disabling auto-answer capabilities.<br /><br />Password protect configuration files, if possible.<br /><br />Regularly review and update users with access to administrative accounts.<br /><br />Segment configuration files on the network. Be sure to protect configuration and other device-related files after getting the device out of the box.

Given sustained bilateral US-Iran tensions, the occurrence of such a catalyst could prompt Shia HVE activity relatively quickly, underscoring the benefits of early engagement with Shia communities about indicators of HVE radicalization. Potential triggering events for such Shia HVE violence include US military action against Iran and Lebanese Hizballah, Shia leadership or senior clerics sanctioning violence in the US, prominent Sunni government attacks on Shia, or high-profile anti-Shia activity in the US, judging from the results of a structured NCTC brainstorming exercise.<br /><br />(U//FOUO) There are no confirmed cases of Shia HVEs who plotted attacks in the US, probably because support for fundamentalist ideology is less prevalent among US Shia than US Sunnis, the hierarchical nature of Shiism, and the absence of a violent triggering event against Shia overseas or in the US. Even if Shia HVE plotting were to emerge, the pool of Shia HVEs would be smaller than that of Sunni HVEs, limiting the scale of the potential threat.<br /><br />(U//FOUO)We identified three key enablers that would probably increase the likelihood of Shia HVEs mobilizing to violence in the wake of a catalyzing event: the emergence of charismatic US-based Shia extremist voices, a persistent online Shia extremist cohort advocating violence in the US, and anti-US rhetoric from Shia media calling for violence in the US.<br /><br />(U//FOUO) Increased community outreach to Shia community groups, mosques, and student organizations in the US about the signposts of extremist behavior could lead to the identification of future plotters and improve efforts to steer those individuals away from violence.<br /><br />(U//FOUO) Many existing law enforcement tools available to help thwart HVE plotting would be applicable to efforts to help identify and mitigate potential plotters, many of whose preoperational behaviors would probably resemble those of other HVE plotters, judging from the results of the NCTC exercise.<br /><br />(U//FOUO) Shia HVEs would be more likely than other HVEs to favor targets symbolic of Jewish interests or the Israeli or Saudi Arabian Governments, judging from the results of the NCTC exercise.<br /><br />(U) Scope Note<br /><br />(U//FOUO) This Special Analysis Report explores the main global drivers that could lead to the emergence of US Shia HVEs and influence them to independently plot attacks in the Homeland. NCTC subject-matter experts on US HVEs, Iran, Hizballah, terrorist propaganda, and terrorist cyber actors conducted a structured analytic brainstorming session to explore the potential for Shia HVE plotters to emerge in the US.<br /><br />(U//FOUO) We assess that US-based HVEs are frequently motivated to engage in violence by a range of factors, including personal issues, which are often difficult to predict or identify before they conduct an attack. Therefore, we cannot discount the possibility that a single Shia HVE plotter could arise at any time, motivated by a unique set of circumstances and individualized grievances.<br /><br />(U//FOUO) NCTC defines an HVE as a person of any citizenship who has lived and/or operated primarily in the US and advocates, is engaged in, or is preparing to engage in ideologically motivated terrorist activities in furtherance of political or social objectives promoted by a foreign terrorist organization but is acting independently of direction. For the purposes of this assessment, we further define Shia HVEs as individuals who are inspired or influenced by state actors such as Iran, foreign terrorist organizations such as Hizballah, or Shia militant groups but who do not belong to these groups and are not directed by them.<br /><br />(U//FOUO) Catalyzing Events Could Lead to Shia HVE Plotting \u2026<br /><br />(U//FOUO) We have identified four catalyzing events that would probably inspire some Shia to engage in violence here without any explicit direction from the Iranian Government, Hizballah, or Shia militant groups. Although some of these events have occurred in the past without the emergence of Shia HVEs in the US, we assess that repeat occurrences of such incidents could contribute to or spark radicalization, judging from the results of the NCTC exercise.<br /><br />(U//FOUO) US Military Actions Abroad Against Iran, Hizballah, or Shia Militants: Direct US military action in Iran, sustained US operations against Hizballah in Lebanon or Syria, or the assassination of a senior Iranian or Hizballah leader perceived to have US involvement would be significant events that might push some US Shia to radicalize and consider retaliatory violence.<br /><br />(U//FOUO) Shia Leaders and Clerics Call for Violence in the US: If Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader removed the prohibition on conducting attacks in the US, the Supreme Leader or Hizballah\u2019s Secretary General called for attacks against the US, or senior Shia clerics issued fatwas urging attacks in the US, some US Shia might feel justified in conducting an attack here. Iranian Supreme Leader Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989 calling for UK author Salman Rushdie\u2019s death, and Iran state-run media issued a $600,000 dollar bounty on Rushdie in 2016, but there have been no confirmed attempts on his life.<br /><br />(U//FOUO ) Israeli Government or Sunni Killing of Shia Individuals: If the Israeli or Saudi Government, or another Sunni government perceived as anti-Shia, conducted a large-scale lethal operation against Iran, Hizballah, or other Shia, Shia worldwide could respond with outrage that might serve as a triggering event for US-based Shia.<br /><br />(U//FOUO) Anti-Shia Activity in the US: A prominent or deadly attack in the US against Shia populations or symbols could spur retaliatory attacks against the perpetrators or a target perceived as complicit or accepting of the anti-Shia activity. Events such as disparaging depictions of Shia religious leaders that Shia Muslims perceive to be inflammatory and denigrating to their beliefs in the US could motivate some US Shia to become receptive to calls for violence.<br /><br />Share this:<br /><br />Related Material From the Archive:<br /><br />", "publish_time": 1569727395964, "collection_time": 1569727395965, "summary": "(U) Key Findings(U//FOUO) We assess that a Shia homegrown violent extremist (HVE) attack in the US is highly unlikely absent a catalyzing event that could galvanize some US-based Shia to engage in", "source": "publicintelligence"}

The explosion killed more than 100 people and wounded approximately 235 others. According to the deputy spokesperson for the Afghanistan Interior Ministry, the vehicle was painted to resemble an ambulance and had successfully passed through a checkpoint after the attacker allegedly told police he was transporting a patient to a nearby hospital. While stopped at a second checkpoint farther inside the city limits, the attacker detonated the explosives concealed in the vehicle.<br /><br />,Intelligence in this assessment is based on data from 125 local, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies through statewide intelligence meetings, adjudicated cases, and open source information. Specific gang data was collected from 71 law enforcement agencies through questionnaires disseminated at the statewide intelligence meetings and the 2017 Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators (MAGI) Conference. The intelligence meetings, sponsored by the MSAIC, occurred in the nine Mississippi Highway Patrol (MHP) districts.<br /><br />,We assess that terrorists likely view tactics involving throwing or spraying acids and a variety of chemical liquids, hereafter referred to as a chemical spray and splash attack (CSSA), as a viable tactic to cause injury and disrupt critical infrastructure, judging from open source reporting describing terrorist social media posts and terrorist and violent extremist use of this tactic overseas. An analysis of a small number of incidents described in media reporting revealed that CSSAs are commonly used by criminal actors to further criminal activities and by violent extremist groups overseas to create fear, intimidate, punish, and disfigure individuals and groups that resist their control or ideology in their area of operations; the tactic, however, has rarely been operationalized by actors in the Homeland. We note, however, that homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) and lone offenders likely would find this tactic appealing and could easily adapt it to the Homeland, as it requires no specific technical expertise and the materials most often associated with criminal attack are usually unregulated and widely available.<br /><br />,On 11 July, the United States Government removed Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab from two lists of approved vendors used by government agencies to purchase technology equipment, amid concerns the cyber security firms products could be used by the Kremlin to gain entry into U.S. networks. Last month the Senate Armed Services Committee passed a defense spending policy bill that would ban Kaspersky products from use in the military. The move came a day after the FBI interviewed several of the companys U.S. employees at their private homes as part of a counterintelligence investigation into its operations.<br /><br />, ,The fusion center has no information to indicate specific or credible threats to people whose names have been published online by violent extremists. You are being provided this advisory to assist your agency in responding to queries from members of the public or other concerned parties. This information, which often includes personally identifiable information (PII) obtained maliciously via the Internet, most likely represents aspirational threats. Its primary purpose is likely to heighten anxiety and a sense of vulnerability. It is unlikely that violent extremist-inspired individuals in the United States will target people identified online, but this cannot be ruled out entirely.<br /><br />Tactics used by violent Anti-fascists at events in Berkeley on 1 February, 4 March, and 15 April 2017 highlight their ability to exploit peaceful protests with coordinated violent demonstrations, attack law enforcement personnel, destroy property, and conduct information campaigns to advance their socio-political goals. This Advisory Bulletin is intended to inform law enforcement involved in operational planning and event safety at gatherings that violent anti-fascist elements may target.<br /><br />,During a recent lawful protest in Orange County, local law enforcement officers discovered various improvised weapons in the possession of protesters or concealed and placed in the vicinity of the protest.<br /><br />,The Delaware State Police (DSP) Intelligence Unit is providing the following information for officer safety and situational awareness. Officers should be mindful, when placing prisoners in custody, of smart watches and similar devices that can connect via Bluetooth to a cellular device. Smart watches have the capability to both make and receive phone calls and text messages, as well as erasing same. This could cause an issue if a cellular device and it\u2019s contents are being used as evidence. Through experimentation at Troop 7, it was determined that if a prisoner is in the detention area and the phone is seized, the watch could still be operational.<br /><br />,In January 2016, EPIC published Intelligence Note 02303-16a, this product provided analysis of data provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and open source reporting that indicated Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) continued to operate and profit from marijuana sales in legalized U.S. marijuana markets. EPIC research further showed that legalization of marijuana in some U.S. markets had not adversely impacted TCO profitability in marijuana markets, and that the effort of legalization had conversely brought new opportunities for illicit profits from marijuana sales. As of January 2017, EPIC research indicates that TCOs continue to exploit legalized marijuana markets in the United States.<br /><br />,The Orange County Intelligence Assessment Center (OCIAC) has received reporting indicating cybercriminals are manipulating e-mail filters as a means to monitor and divert e-mail communications.<br /><br />,Public Safety personnel are urged to use caution when sharing information via social media. With recent officer-involved shootings around the country, those who support attacks against public safety affiliates can gain access to information shared online and may use it to condone violence.<br /><br />,Use of vehicles by violent extremists for ramming attacks has increased steadily, while use of vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) remains rare outside the Middle East. Given the ease with which ramming attacks can be accomplished, it is likely use of this tactic will continue to rise. Unlike VBIEDs, ramming attacks require little specialized training or skill, present minimal risk of detection when acquiring the weapon, and offer flexibility with regard to preparation, timing, and target. Foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs) have pointedly encouraged use of vehicle ramming attacks, offering explicit tactical advice on vehicle selection, driving tips to maximize fatalities, and targeting suggestions that include parades, festivals, street fairs, outdoor markets or conventions, political rallies, and other crowded targets of opportunity.<br /><br />, , ,This Joint Threat Assessment (JTA) addresses threats to the 2017 Presidential Address to a Joint Session of Congress (the Presidential Address) at the US Capitol Building in Washington, DC, on 28 February 2017. This assessment does not consider nonviolent civil disobedience tactics (for example, protests without a permit) that are outside the scope of federal law enforcement jurisdiction; however, civil disobedience tactics designed to cause a hazard to public safety and/or law enforcement fall within the scope of this assessment.<br /><br />,This Reference Aid is intended to provide information on malicious terrorism hoaxes that will continue to challenge first responder resources throughout the Homeland and territories. This Reference Aid is provided by I&#038;A, DIAC, NCRIC, NVRIC, and NJ-ROIC to support their respective activities, to provide situational awareness, and to assist federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government counterterrorism and law enforcement officials and first responders with recognizing the indicators and implications of malicious terrorism hoaxes. The use of hoax calls may also be used as a technique to lure authorities to a particular location for the purpose of conducting a potential attack, but is not discussed in this article, as luring is viewed as its own distinct tactic.<br /><br />,The healthcare sector has been a desirable target for hackers due to the sensitive nature of patient information contained in their systems. The stakes are very high in the healthcare industry because any disruption in operations and care can have significant repercussions for patients. As such, this industry offers an ideal victim for ransomware, and these attacks are likely to continue\u2014disrupting employee access to important documents and patient data and hampering the ability to provide critical services\u2014creating a public safety concern.<br /><br />,Recent reporting at the local, state, and national level indicates both violence and threats of violence against law enforcement. Recently, the activity has expanded beyond law enforcement, affecting non-sworn first responders as well as public partners (such as transportation employees).<br /><br />,The NJ ROIC currently has no specific indication of any credible specific threats to transportation facilities. However, with the rise in \u201cself-radicalized\u201d actor(s), and homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) influenced by ISIL and other terror groups, targeted violent attacks to any of these sectors could occur with little or no notice by an individual(s) who has not yet garnered law enforcement attention. This advisory highlights recent transportation concerns in the wake of the recent attacks in Belgium.<br /><br />,Several recent incidents underline the possibility that soft targets, including entertainment venues such as bars and restaurants, are increasingly chosen over hard targets that may hold more significance to the victims and the attacking person or group. Using analysis of recent events and data from the START Global Terrorism Database, the BRIC completed the following study to raise awareness regarding the targeting of entertainment venues by violent extremist groups.<br /><br />,Encounters in 2015 of unauthorized unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), also known as drones, with public safety aircraft during emergency events underscore the potential threats UAS pose to response efforts\u2014notably search-and-rescue, firefighting and police air assets\u2014as well as the lives, property and natural resources already at risk.<br /><br />,This document is intended to highlight several suspicious activity behaviors and indicators that may be indicative of preoperational terrorist activity for business owners and private sector security personnel. This product focuses on behaviors and indicators that would be of interest prior to any major event. This proactive public safety strategy is an ongoing attempt to provide our private sector partners with some information on suspicious activity.<br /><br />,Recent events surrounding the occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Harney County Oregon, have culminated in the fatal confrontation of Northern Arizona rancher, LaVoy Finicum. His funeral services will be held on 05 FEB 2016, in Kanab, UT. Finicum will be buried on 06 FEB 2016, close to his Arizona ranch in Cane Beds, AZ. While no credible threats to law enforcement are present at this time, armed extremists are expected to travel through UT; some of which may see this event as a tipping point, and potentially shift toward more violent action. A number of individuals, several of whom were present at the Burns, OR occupation, are planning caravans from UT and NV to travel to the funeral in show of support.<br /><br />,In September 2014, The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) released a propaganda video encouraging its followers to murder \u201cintelligence officers, police officers, soldiers and civilians.\u201d The video was re-released in January 2015 and specifically named the United States, France, Australia and Canada as targets. Now, first responders have an additional threat: Impersonation and misrepresentation by terrorists as first responders. The impersonators main goals are to further their attack plan and do harm to unsuspecting citizens as well as members of the emergency services community.<br /><br />,A report from the Delaware Valley Intelligence Center on administrations of Narcan, a drug that treats opioid overdose symptoms, between January 1, 2015 through June 30, 2015<br /><br />,The New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness (OHSP) compiles a statewide list of special events that provides situational awareness to law enforcement, as well as to assist in local planning requirements. Special events include any events that attracts large numbers of participants. Examples include concerts, marathons, parades, sporting events, holiday gatherings, etc.<br /><br />,SWATTING is the act of sending a SWAT team or some type of law enforcement response to a location by convincing law enforcement that an incident has occurred or is about to occur that requires immediate law enforcement response. Characteristics of swatting include, but are not limited to: Callers using internet-based phones such as Skype USBUS and Magic Jack USBUS, or callers using a legal Caller Identification (ID) masking service. Caller ID spoofing/masking services permit cell phones and landline phones to spoof the call\u2019s origins through a service fee based software. Reports of bomb-threats and SWATTING incidents are coming from area elementary, middle, and high schools, along with universities as well. Federal, state, and local partners are working to identify where the calls are originating from.<br /><br />Page 1 of 91<br /><br />&hellip;\ufeffSearch for:<br /><br />Follow UsA D V E R T I S E M E N T<br /><br />Categories&bull;", "publish_time": 1569727388739, "collection_time": 1569727388740, "summary": "", "source": "publicintelligence"}

The storm left 42 dead in New York State (NYS), thousands homeless and millions without power. Superstorm Sandy began as a tropical wave in the Caribbean on October 19, 2012. It quickly developed into a tropical depression and then a tropical storm in six hours. It quickly moved north, then turned northwest within the next week, making landfall on October 29, 2012 striking near Atlantic City, New Jersey with winds of 80 miles per hour. At one point, Superstorm Sandy\u2019s hurricane force winds (74 mph) extended up to 175 miles from its center and tropical storm force winds (39 mph) out to 485 miles.

The Domain Awareness System not only supplies critical supplemental assistance to officers\u2019 ongoing security and public safety efforts, but also enhances the collaborative nature of those efforts by leveraging the resources of the private sector and other City agencies. Given the ongoing threat of terrorist attack, the Domain Awareness System is an important part of the NYPD\u2019s integrated approach to providing protection for those who work in, live in, and visit New York City.<br /><br />,Criminals and terrorists have long used official vehicles, cloned vehicles (those painted/decorated to appear official), or seemingly legitimate vehicles (e.g. livery, maintenance or delivery) to circumvent security measures at targets of interest. There have been numerous terrorist attacks overseas wherein operatives used police vehicles or ambulances (or vehicles painted to resemble same) to conceal improvised explosive devices. Within the US Homeland, the most common use of cloned official vehicles by criminals is for drug smuggling; however, at least one terrorist targeting New York envisioned misusing vehicles that would appear to be legitimate, in order to conduct an attack. Dhiren Barot, an al Qaeda operative involved in the 2004 Financial Centers Plot, allegedly plotted to detonate three limousines packed with explosives and gas cylinders in underground parking lots in Manhattan. While the limousines would not have masqueraded as official vehicles per se they would have appeared to be legitimately entering those parking structures.<br /><br />, , , , ,International terrorist groups and violent extremists have long shown interest in using fire as a weapon due to the low cost and limited technical expertise required, the potential for causing large-scale damage, and the low risk of apprehension.

The Park is owned by a Brookfield affiliate and was recently renovated at Brookfields considerable expense as an amenity for the general public. It is intended to be a relaxing tree-filled oasis in the midst of the hustle and bustle of Lower Manhattan. We fully support the rights of free speech and assembly, but the manner in which the protesters are occupying the Park violates the law, violates the rules of the Park, deprives the community of its rights of quiet enjoyment to the Park, and creates health and public safety issues that need to be addressed immediately. Within the Park, the protesters have set up living spaces with tarpaulins, mattresses, sleeping bags, tables, bookshelves, gasoline-powered generators and other items that arc inconsistent with the rules and normal public use of the Park. At all hours of the day and night, protesters arc sleeping on benches and walkways, blocking normal pedestrian access to the general public and preventing cleaning and maintenance workers from performing necessary upkeep. When not blocked by protesters, the walkways throughout the Park are blocked by the various items and equipment brought to the Park by the protesters.<br /><br />,FBI New York case information indicates that Bloods gang members in the Bronx, NY are utilizing PlayStation Network (PSN) to communicate each other while on house arrest.

These individuals have been observed sharing \u201ctag names\u201d with each other and discussing intentions to communicate through PSN.<br /><br />As authorities have clamped down on traditional financing pipelines, such as charitable front groups, and as terrorist networks have grown increasingly decentralized, terrorists have turned to criminal activities to finance their operations locally. Throughout the world, Al Qaeda, Hamas, and Hezbollah operatives have involved themselves in an array of criminal enterprises, including counterfeiting, drug dealing, cigarette smuggling, credit card fraud, auto theft, kidnapping, extortion, and artifact trafficking. Although criminality is outlawed under Islamic law, the Al Qaeda manual advises that \u201cnecessity permits the forbidden.\u201d Reflecting this theory, when Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) operatives questioned whether hacking into foreigners\u2019 bank accounts was acceptable in Islam, JI leader Abu Bakr Bashir reportedly responded, \u201c[if] you can take their blood; then why not take their property?\u201d Terrorist groups are particularly interested in raising funds through crime because as Lieutenant Colonel David LaRivee, Associate Professor of Economics at the United States Air Force Academy, stated, \u201cmany of the agencies responsible for enforcement in these areas do not traditionally focus on counterterrorism nor do they have strong ties with counterterrorist agencies. This means that many indictable criminal activities that support terrorism are overlooked because they seem insignificant when evaluated locally, but are in fact very significant when considered from a broader perspective.\u201d In order to disrupt these financing efforts, \u201clocal law enforcement officials will be key,\u201d as the FBI assessed in a May 25, 2005 Intelligence Bulletin.<br /><br />,New York State Intelligence Center Concealment Smartbook from April 2009.<br /><br />,The defendant engaged in oral sexual conduct and anal sexual conduct with another person by forcible compulsion; the defendant attempted to engage in sexual intercourse with another person by forcible compulsion; the defendant subjected another person to sexual contact by forcible compulsion; the defendant restrained another person; the defendant subjected another person to sexual contact without the latters consent; and in that the defendant intentionally, and for no legitimate purpose, forcibly touched the sexual and other intimate parts of another person for the purpose of degrading and abusing such person, and for the purpose of gratifying the defendants sexual desire.<br /><br />Eighty-five percent of the critical infrastructure in the United States belongs to private enterprise and corporations. Thus, security guards are literally one of the nation\u2019s first groups of defenders and play an integral role in prevention and deterrence efforts. Success in prevention and deterrence of both general crime, and terrorist acts as well, begins with the establishment of a baseline and maintenance of a robust all-hazards and all-crimes management infrastructure. The professional security guard industry in New York State with an excess of 140,000 certified security guards inhabit that baseline. This program will provide security guards with the basic awareness of terrorism issues that can potentially affect responsibilities within the purview of their employment. It will improve observation, detection and reporting capabilities while enhancing coordination capability with other emergency response professionals. Additionally, this program will elaborate on previously provided instruction, thereby elevating participants\u2019 familiarity with access control issues and security technology.<br /><br />Page 1 of 31<br /><br />\ufeffSearch for:<br /><br />Follow UsA D V E R T I S E M E N T<br /><br />Categories&bull;", "publish_time": 1569727350774, "collection_time": 1569727350774, "summary": "A presentation from the Fire Department City of New York (FDNY), Center for Terrorism and Disaster Preparedness regarding the November 2015 terror attacks in Paris, France.", "source": "publicintelligence"}

Some of the PLAs writings on systems attack are clearly aspirational, but this does not preclude the effectiveness of the approach, and the doctrine shows that the Pl.A is thinking seriously and realistically about how to defeat.an advanced adversary. The requirements of system attack are actively driving PLA reform, acquisitions, operations and training, and the doctrine telegraphs how Chine intends to fight.<br /><br />All modern forces depend on the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). The military requirement for unimpeded access to, and use of, the EMS is the key focus for joint electromagnetic spectrum operations (JEMSO), both in support of military operations and as the focus of operations themselves. Electronic warfare (EW) is essential for protecting friendly operations and denying adversary operations within the EMS throughout the operational environment.<br /><br />,This white paper was prepared as part of the Strategic Multilayer Asssessment, entitled The Future of Global Competition and Conflict. Twenty-three expert contributors contributed to this white paper and provided wide-ranging assessments of Russia\u2019s global interests and objectives, as well as the activities\u2014gray or otherwise\u2014that it conducts to achieve them. This white paper is divided into five sections and twenty-five chapters, as described below. This summary reports some of the white paper\u2019s high-level findings, but it is no substitute for a careful read of the individual contributions.<br /><br />Commanders ensure operational security (OPSEC) is practiced during all phases of operations. OPSEC is a capability that identifies and controls critical information, indicators of friendly force actions attendant to military operations, and incorporates countermeasures to reduce the risk of an adversary exploiting vulnerabilities. As adversary analysts apply more information to an analytical model, the likelihood increases that the analytical model will replicate the observed force. Thus, current and future capabilities and courses of action can be revealed and compromised.<br /><br />Peace operations are activities intended to build, keep, enforce, or make peace, or when necessary, prevent conflict. They include crisis response and limited contingency operations and frequently involve international military missions to contain conflict, restore peace, and shape the strategic security environment to support reconciliation and rebuilding, as well as to facilitate the transition to legitimate governance. They include peacekeeping operations (PKO), peace building, peacemaking, conflict prevention, and peace enforcement operations (PEO). Peace operations may be conducted under the sponsorship of the United Nations (UN), another international organization, within a coalition of nations, or unilaterally.<br /><br />Nuclear weapons are a key feature of the security environment. Adversaries increasingly rely on nuclear weapons to secure their interests. Those seeking ways to use nuclear weapons for coercion and war termination present complex deterrence and escalation management challenges. US nuclear weapons and the associated capabilities needed to conduct nuclear operations are essential to ensure an effective deterrent.<br /><br />Cyberspace operations (CO) is the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace. This publication focuses on military operations in and through cyberspace; explains the relationships and responsibilities of the Joint Staff (JS), combatant commands (CCMDs), United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), the Service cyberspace component (SCC) commands, and combat support agencies; and establishes a framework for the employment of cyberspace forces and capabilities.<br /><br />, ,In the pluralized, multipolar world, in which military and economic sources of power are widely distributed and technologies are making nation states increasingly more porous, the US and its partners face significant challenges on how best to adapt and thrive in a period of revolutionary changes. These factors may change the way US analysts, planners, and operators evaluate approaches in order to affect and direct the outcomes of military operations. To date, such courses of actions to a large extend have focused on compelling adversaries through the threat or application of force to achieve victory (i.e., \u201ccontrol\u201d). In this changing geopolitical/technical landscape, it is increasingly clear that the DOD needs complement \u201ccontrol\u201d with an explicit focus upon \u201cinfluence\u201d factors and forces that produce desired behavioral outcomes across complex and intermeshed human and technical systems.<br /><br />, ,Key Observations There was consensus among SMA researchers and observers that: \u2022 Da\u2019esh represents a compound threat: it is both the organization and the violent extremist idea it represents. \u2022 Da\u2019esh battlefield loss in Iraq/Syria theater will not bring about&hellip;<br /><br />The Joint Operating Environment 2035 (JOE 2035) is designed to encourage the purposeful preparation of the Joint Force to effectively protect the United States, its interests, and its allies in 2035. For the Joint Force, thinking through the most important conditions in a changing world can mean the difference between victory and defeat, success and failure, and the needless expenditure of human lives and national treasure versus the judicious and prudent application of both to defend our vital interests.<br /><br />,The underlying concept of this paper is how bio-psycho-social approaches to cognitive engagement, described in greater depth by DeGennaro, may be put to use to collect, analyze, and/or apply information to meet a tactical, operational, or strategic end. This White Paper will focus on the proverbial \u201crubber meets the road\u201d approaches of behavioral operations in the human domain where the former is \u201cthe study of attributes of human behavior and cognition that impact the design, management, and improvement of operating systems, and the study of the interaction between such attributes and operating systems and processes\u201d and the latter is \u201cthe presence, activities (including transactions both physical and virtual), culture, social structure/organization, networks and relationships, motivation, intent, vulnerabilities, and capabilities of humans (single or groups) across all domains of the operational environment (Space, Air, Maritime, Ground, and Cyber).\u201d Information Operations (IO) doctrine defines the cognitive domain as the component of the information environment (IE) that encompasses the gray matter of those who transmit, receive, and act upon information. Cognitive operations such as information processing, perception, judgment, and decision-making are the most vital aspect of the IE. Cognition is influenced by individual and cultural beliefs, norms, vulnerabilities, motivations, emotions, experiences, morals, education, mental health, identities, and ideologies and thus requires research and analysis methods from the bio-psycho-social sciences to understand and manipulate. When, how, and most importantly why to apply that understanding to US advantage at the tactical, operational, and strategic level is the focus of this effort.<br /><br />, , ,When planning to deal with any adversary or potential adversaries, it is essential to understand who they are, how they function, their strengths and vulnerabilities, and why they oppose us. Events over the course of the last year and a half highlight the importance of those factors as they relate to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or Da\u2019esh). One of Da\u2019esh\u2019s obvious strengths is its ability to propagate tailored messages that resonate with its audiences. If the US Government and our allies are to counter Da\u2019esh effectively, we must attack this center of gravity.<br /><br />, ,This paper was produced in support of the Strategic Multi-layer Assessment (SMA) of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) led by Joint Staff J39 in support of the Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT). The paper leverages and melds the latest thinking of academic and operational subject matter experts in fields of organizational and social dynamics, network analysis, psychology, information operations and narrative development, social media analysis, and doctrine development related to aspects of maneuver and engagement in the narrative space.<br /><br />,This White Paper makes a significant contribution to the study of terrorist behavior in general and ISIL behavior in particular. Unique in this work is the melding of neuroscientific considerations about the basic structures and functions of the brain with social and cultural influences in order to provide a holistic insight into the motivations for terrorist behaviors. Importantly, this paper also explores the relationship between the narratives that support terrorist behavior and the neuro-cognitive processes that contribute to those behaviors. That relationship is accurately portrayed as symbiotic in the sense that one can only truly understand seemingly aberrant behavior if one understands the continuous ebb and flow of chemical and cultural influences that are manifested in an individual\u2019s actions.<br /><br />This concise review presents theories, findings, and techniques from the neurobiology and cognitive sciences, as well as insights from the operational community, to provide a current and comprehensive description of why individuals and groups engage in violent political behavior. This report is based primarily on recent findings from the academic community. It has been compiled with the policy, planning, and operational community as the primary audience.<br /><br />, ,During FY 2014, the SOCCENT Commander requested a short-term effort to understand the psychological, ideological, narrative, emotional, cultural, and inspirational (\u201cintangible\u201d) nature of ISIL. As shown below, the SMA1 team really addressed two related questions: \u201cWhat makes ISIL attractive?\u201d or how has the idea or ideology of ISIL gained purchase with different demographics; and \u201cWhat makes ISIL successful?\u201d or which of the organization\u2019s characteristics and which of the tactics it has employed account for its push across Syria and Iraq. The effort produced both high-level results and detailed analyses of the factors contributing to each question. The central finding was this: While military action might degrade or defeat factors that make ISIL successful, it cannot overcome what makes ISIL\u2019s message and idea attractive.<br /><br />, ,Early in 2014, as it became clear that the rise of the so-\u00adcalled \u201cIslamic State\u201d was becoming a significant menace to Regional Stability and US Interests, SOCCENT began a dialogue with Dr. Hriar Cabayan and his co-workers regarding a topic that has been at the core of the struggle against Violent Extremism. That question has been, and remains today, a perplexing one for those of us from Western cultures and societies: \u201cWhat precisely are we contesting, and what is it that fuels the adversary\u2019s power?\u201d The contents of this paper reflect some of the work that Dr. Cabayan and his colleagues are doing to help us understand and comprehend this \u201cintangible power\u201d across a unique enterprise of academicians, scientists, policy intellectuals, current and former Foreign Service, military, and intelligence professionals. Most importantly, their efforts to improve our comprehension will enable us to adjust our efforts, our operations, our investments, and our risk-\u00ad\u2010calculations to more effectively contest it and the organization that wields it. I am grateful for their tireless work in this regard, and I commend it to the reader.<br /><br />Provide notice to the Joint Force on the minimal required training and force health protection procedures for Service Members deploying to Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) affected areas.<br /><br />,In order to develop the ANP, the Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan (CSTC-A) uses Police Mentor Teams to help develop them. A shortage of PMTs across the country, however, has led to the formation of in-lieu of advisor teams comprised of Soldiers from land owning units or attached Military Police units. The purpose of this document is to help provide those additional advisory teams with information they need to develop the skills required to effectively augment the CSTC-A program. This handbook will provide an overview of the entire police program including current goals, relationships to other organizations, the Focused District Development Program, key challenges that may be encountered and the duties of key members of the police advising teams including how to work with the team\u2019s enablers.<br /><br />,This guide is a JCISFA publication on mentoring the Afghan National Army and is applicable to advisors, mentors and partner forces executing Security Force Assistance (SFA) operations. The guide is a companion to the May 2009 JCISFA Afghan National Police Mentor Guide and addresses identified gaps in mentoring Afghan National Security Forces. The guide offers cultural background information, partner security force challenges, advisor/mentor best practices, and challenges. As the United States assists other nations, our forces must adopt a by, with, and through strategy to enable a supported nation and its security forces to generate and sustain capabilities institutionally and operationally. We can achieve this by advising and mentoring them, partnering with the supported nation and through development of the supported nation and its security forces so that they can do it themselves.<br /><br />When advising and assisting partner nation security ministries and their institutions, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) leverages the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA) from a combination of senior uniformed and civilian personnel, to include contractors to carryout development in a broad range of partner nation ministries and institutional requirements.<br /><br />The purpose of this instruction is to document the Department of Defense (DoD) policy governing the No-strike process, management of No-strike entities, treatment of collateral objects, and the logic, processes, and procedures of the collateral damage estimation (CDE) methodology (CDM).<br /><br />This manual provides the information technology (IT) system-level information required to support readiness data entry into GSORTS. The intended audience is the Services, combatant commands, and CSAs to ensure organization unique IT systems (if any) and readiness assessment data meet requirements.<br /><br />,The reference provides warning and other appropriate measures to guard against the outbreak of nuclear war, either as a result of planned intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) or submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) launches, or unauthorized or unexplained accidents or incidents involving a US space launch or event or implying a possible threat of a nuclear attack. Because the highest national importance is attached to agreements with the Russian Federation, the United States intends to prevent any event that would violate the agreements and implement actions minimizing the effect of any incident that might occur.<br /><br />The GEOFILE is the authoritative automated repository of the Department of Defense for the registration of military installations and worldwide geographic locations subject to reference during military planning and operations.<br /><br />Page 1 of 31<br /><br />\ufeffSearch for:<br /><br />Follow UsA D V E R T I S E M E N T<br /><br />Categories&bull;", "publish_time": 1569727317352, "collection_time": 1569727317352, "summary": "This White Paper will focus on the proverbial \u201crubber meets the road\u201d approaches of behavioral operations in the human domain where the former is \u201cthe study of attributes of human behavior and cognition that impact the design, management, and improvement of operating systems, and the study of the interaction between such attributes and operating systems and processes\u201d and the latter is \u201cthe presence, activities (including transactions both physical and virtual), culture, social structure/organization, networks and relationships, motivation, intent, vulnerabilities, and capabilities of humans (single or groups) across all domains of the operational environment (Space, Air, Maritime, Ground, and Cyber).", "source": "publicintelligence"}

With the 2008 military incursion into Georgia and the 2014 seizure of Crimea and support for pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, Russia has assumed a more aggressive, interventionist stance in Europe. In the effort to influence events in Ukraine, the Russians have used what the US Army defines as \u201cHybrid Warfare\u201d to infiltrate, isolate, and dominate eastern Ukraine and Crimea.

According to the Department of Defense in its report to Congress and the intelligence community, the DPRK \u201cremains one of the United States\u2019 most critical security challenges for many reasons. These include North Korea\u2019s willingness to undertake provocative and destabilizing behavior, including attacks on the Republic of Korea (ROK), its pursuit of nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles, and its willingness to proliferate weapons in contravention of United Nations Security Council Resolutions.\u201d<br /><br />ATP 2-33.4 provides information on how intelligence personnel conduct intelligence analysis in support of unified land operations. It describes approaches used to conduct intelligence analysis and describes how intelligence analysis assists commanders with understanding the complex environments in which Army forces conduct operations.<br /><br />Urban warfare is not a new phenomenon. The U.S. Army saw urban combat in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, and elsewhere. Starting with World War II, overall armed conflict began to occur around centers with a high population density. This new backdrop for conflict has caused a whole new set of challenges, especially in an era of public scrutiny. The \u201cArmy\u2019s capacity to engage, fight, and win major urban combat operations will determine the success of future operational and strategic endeavors.\u201d<br /><br />As the American Army fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, it became the best tactical level counter insurgency force of the modern era. America\u2019s enemies, however, did not rest. Russia observed the transformation of the American Army and began a transformation of their own. This new military barely resembles its former Soviet self. Wielding a sophisticated blend of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), electronic warfare (EW) jamming equipment, and long range rocket artillery, it took the Soviet model out of the 1980s and into the 21st Century.<br /><br />The Mad Scientist 2050 Cyber Army project explored the visualization of the Army\u2019s Cyber Force out to 2050 and its ability to address three major objectives of the Army\u2019s Cyberspace Strategy for Unified Land Operations 2025: What does the cyber environment look like in 2040-2050 (how will cyber influence the environment and the population? What will connecting look like / what will they connect to? What are the drivers influencing this or not)?  How do we build an Army Cyber Force that can dominate the cyber domain in the context of the multi-domain battle concept to gain a position of relative advantage? How can we build shared goals and expectations as well as develop an understanding of roles and responsibilities in order to build and maintain partnerships with U.S., and international academia, industry, defense departments/ministries and other agencies to enhance cyberspace operations? What new ideas should we be considering? Co-sponsored by the TRADOC G-2 and the Army Cyber Institute at the United States Military Academy, the 2050 Cyber Army project leveraged submitted papers, an on-line technology survey, and a 13-14 September Mad Scientist Conference that generated the insights synthesized in this report.<br /><br />This TC serves as a guide to describe the fundamentals of how to incorporate IO at the tactical and operational level. Appendixes A through F offer tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) Special Forces (SF) Soldiers can use to analyze and plan information operations. This TC implements Army and joint IO doctrine established in FM 3-13, Inform and Influence Activities, and Joint Publication (JP) 3-13, Information Operations. This TC reinforces the definition of IO used by Army forces: IO employs the core capabilities of electronic warfare (EW), computer network operations (CNO), Military Information Support operations (MISO), military deception (MILDEC), and operations security (OPSEC), in concert with specified supporting and related capabilities, to affect or defend information and information systems and to influence decisionmaking. This TC is specifically targeted for SF; however, it is also useful to Army special operations forces (ARSOF) and the Army in understanding how SF employs IO.<br /><br />Published in three volumes, (Ground; Airspace &#038; Air Defense Systems; and Naval &#038; Littoral Systems) the WEG is the approved document for OPFOR equipment data used in U.S. Army training. Annual updates are posted on the ATN website. Therefore it is available for downloading and local distribution. Distribution restriction is unlimited. This issue replaces all previous issues.<br /><br />The primary goal of Boko Haram is to institute an Islamic state throughout Nigeria based on a fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law with an inevitable regional expansion. The founder and spiritual leader of Boko Haram, Muhammed Yusuf, and his followers originally believed in a peaceful transition and made what the current Boko Haram leadership considered illegitimate concessions to and compromises with secular and government leaders. The group has since adopted a takfirist ideology\u2014the belief that less than a strict adherence to Salafist Islam makes a Muslim an \u201capostate\u201d equal to infidels and, therefore, a legitimate target. Boko Haram has targeted and killed a number of prominent Muslim leaders who have been critical of the organization. Boko Haram considers any support of Western or secular ideas, such as schools based on Western influence, heretical and worthy of attack.<br /><br />,Today\u2019s military innovators are the modern-day scientists and engineers who assist in the creation of contemporary and new concept weaponry; and the military theorists who study changes in the character of war. Digital specialists understand how to develop and employ the capabilities of electronic warfare equipment, satellite technology, and fiber optic cables. While Kalashnikov\u2019s fame is imbedded in Russia\u2019s culture, it may be harder to find a current digital entrepreneur whose legacy will endure as long as his: there are simply too many of them, and their time in the spotlight appears to be quite short, since even now we are about to pass from the age of cyber to that of quantum. It is difficult to predict whose discoveries will be the most coveted by tomorrow\u2019s military-industrial complex, not to mention the decision-making apparatus of the Kremlin and General Staff. Military theorists are playing an important role as well. They are studying how new weaponry has changed the correlation of forces in the world, the nature of war, and the impact of weaponry on both forecasting and the initial period of war.<br /><br />CI focuses on negating, mitigating, or degrading the foreign intelligence and security services (FISS) and international terrorist organizations (ITO) collection threat that targets Army interests through the conduct of investigations, operations, collection, analysis, production, and technical services and support.<br /><br />The purpose of this study is to provide a synthesis of the prevailing issues and analysis concerning the legal status of persons in resistance. This document refers broadly to resistance and those involved in it, meaning those individuals comprising the resistance element, US personnel supporting or countering the resistance, and the standing government. In alignment with this focus, the document explores the status of personnel particularly in foreign internal defense (FID), counterinsurgency (COIN), and unconventional warfare (UW) operations. When originally conceived, this manuscript was to be an updated volume of the 1961 American University Special Operations Research Office (SORO) study, The Legal Status of Participants in Unconventional Warfare. The National Security Analysis Department (NSAD) of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) was asked by the US Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), G-3X Special Programs Division, to review and analyze the historical use of international law, the law of land warfare, and applicable international conventions and update the SORO study accordingly and also include unique legal considerations regarding the status of irregular forces. Because many aspects of both law and policy have changed since the 1961 publication, particularly within the context of US involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq, USASOC requested that this manuscript be a new document to account for these changes, highlight key legal questions, and position these questions within the context of hypothetical scenarios and historical examples.<br /><br />A map from February 2016 depicting various ethnic groups in Iraq and Syria throughout the region controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).<br /><br />,The underlying concept of this paper is how bio-psycho-social approaches to cognitive engagement, described in greater depth by DeGennaro, may be put to use to collect, analyze, and/or apply information to meet a tactical, operational, or strategic end. This White Paper will focus on the proverbial \u201crubber meets the road\u201d approaches of behavioral operations in the human domain where the former is \u201cthe study of attributes of human behavior and cognition that impact the design, management, and improvement of operating systems, and the study of the interaction between such attributes and operating systems and processes\u201d and the latter is \u201cthe presence, activities (including transactions both physical and virtual), culture, social structure/organization, networks and relationships, motivation, intent, vulnerabilities, and capabilities of humans (single or groups) across all domains of the operational environment (Space, Air, Maritime, Ground, and Cyber).\u201d Information Operations (IO) doctrine defines the cognitive domain as the component of the information environment (IE) that encompasses the gray matter of those who transmit, receive, and act upon information. Cognitive operations such as information processing, perception, judgment, and decision-making are the most vital aspect of the IE. Cognition is influenced by individual and cultural beliefs, norms, vulnerabilities, motivations, emotions, experiences, morals, education, mental health, identities, and ideologies and thus requires research and analysis methods from the bio-psycho-social sciences to understand and manipulate. When, how, and most importantly why to apply that understanding to US advantage at the tactical, operational, and strategic level is the focus of this effort.<br /><br />Army commanders rely upon timely, relevant, and accurate combat information and intelligence in order to successfully plan, prepare, and execute operations. Human intelligence (HUMINT) and counterintelligence (CI) are two critical assets commanders have, either organic to their unit\u2019s table of organization and equipment (TOE) or through attachment from a supporting command, which can provide input to both combat information and intelligence. While there are similarities between the methodology and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) used by HUMINT and CI, their training and missions are separate and distinct.<br /><br />This manual identifies the individual MOS training requirements for soldiers in MOS 96U. Commanders, trainers, and soldiers should use it to plan, conduct, and evaluate individual training in their unit. This manual is the primary MOS reference to support the self-development and training of every 96U soldier.<br /><br />, , ,When planning to deal with any adversary or potential adversaries, it is essential to understand who they are, how they function, their strengths and vulnerabilities, and why they oppose us. Events over the course of the last year and a half highlight the importance of those factors as they relate to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or Da\u2019esh). One of Da\u2019esh\u2019s obvious strengths is its ability to propagate tailored messages that resonate with its audiences. If the US Government and our allies are to counter Da\u2019esh effectively, we must attack this center of gravity.<br /><br />This data set consists of twenty-one teleoperated weapons systems used by terrorist and insurgent groups. It is worth noting that there are many more systems\u2019 images available, but no group affiliation could be associated with them, which is why they were not included in this research project. The plethora of videos and photos on social media indicates that terror and insurgent groups are increasingly turning to improvised weaponry use on the battlefield. One class of improvised weapon that is emerging is remote controlled sniper rifles and machine guns. They are being used across Syria, Iraq, and a lone case in Libya as early as 2011. Typically, rifles or machine guns are improvised to be secured on a base\u2014either mobile or stationary\u2014and linked to cables, which are connected to a remote and screen. Some systems are more refined than others, such as with cameras, but all have at least proven to be somewhat effective.<br /><br />Page 1 of 121<br /><br />&hellip;\ufeffSearch for:<br /><br />Follow UsA D V E R T I S E M E N T<br /><br />Categories&bull;", "publish_time": 1569727288969, "collection_time": 1569727288970, "summary": "", "source": "publicintelligence"}

The focus of this document is the unique, bilateral military planning considerations required to align our respective national military plans to respond quickly to national requests for military support of civil authorities. Nothing in this plan prevents either nation from responding unilaterally; rather, this plan will facilitate unity of effort, if and when requests for bilateral support are received.<br /><br />Natural or man-made disasters and special events can be so demanding that local, tribal) state and non-military federal responders are temporarily overwhelmed by the situation. The Department of Defense (DOD) has a long history of supporting civil authorities in the wake of catastrophic events. When directed by the President or the Secretary of Defense (SecDef), United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) will respond quickly and effectively to the requests of civil authorities to save livesj prevent human suffering, and mitigate great property damage. The Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan 2008 (JSCP) directs CDRUSNORTHCOM to prepare a plan to support the employment of Title 10 DOD forces providing Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) in accordance with (IAW) the National Response Framework (NRF), applicable federal law, DOD Directives (DODD), and other policy guidance including those hazards defined by the National Planning Scenarios that are not addressed by other JSCP tasked plans.

{"url": "https://publicintelligence.net/category/documents/united-states-documents/department-of-justice-united-states-documents-documents/", "title": "Department of Justice", "authors": "", "content": "The Internet Research Agency (IRA) carried out the earliest Russian interference operations identified by the investigation-a social media campaign designed to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States. The IRA was based in St. Petersburg, Russia, and received funding from Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Prigozhin and companies he controlled.  The IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to sow discord in the U.S. political system through what it termed information warfare. The campaign evolved from a generalized program designed in 2014 and 2015 to undermine the U.S. electoral system, to a targeted operation that by early 2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged candidate Clinton. The IRAs operation also included the purchase of political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities, as well as the staging of political rallies inside the United States. To organize those rallies, IRA employees posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and made contact with Trump supporters and Trump Campaign officials in the United States. The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated with the IRA. Section II of this report details the Offices investigation of the Russian social media campaign.<br /><br />Since its founding in 2012, the National Institute of Justice\u2019s Domestic Radicalization to Terrorism program has sponsored research on how radicalization to terrorism occurs in the United States in order to support prevention and intervention efforts. These projects have taken a variety of approaches to examining the process of radicalization to terrorism, but in spite of this there is substantial overlap in their findings, which collectively provide evidence of the importance of several facilitators of radicalization and the need to take into account how this process unfolds within individuals over time.<br /><br />As a result of the fundamental shift in communications services and technologies, criminal and national security investigations are unable to obtain needed evidence and intelligence despite having the legal authority to do so.<br /><br />The increasing demand for opioids in the United States coupled with the availability of fentanyl presents a significant public health risk and negatively impacts officer safety. In 2018, the Arizona High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) Counter Narcotics Alliance (CNA) task force seized tablets that appeared to be Xanax but actually contained a combination of cyclopropylfentanyl, methamphetamine, and a synthetic cannabinoid chemical.<br /><br />This Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Intelligence Report contains new and updated information on slang terms and code words from a variety of law enforcement and open sources, and serves as an updated version to the product entitled \u201cDrug Slang Code Words\u201d published by the DEA in May 2017. It is designed as a ready reference for law enforcement personnel who are confronted with hundreds of slang terms and code words used to identify a wide variety of controlled substances, designer drugs, synthetic compounds, measurements, locations, weapons, and other miscellaneous terms relevant to the drug trade. Although every effort was made to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information presented, due to the dynamics of the ever-changing drug scene, subsequent additions, deletions, and corrections are inevitable. Future addendums and updates to this report will attempt to capture changed terminology to the furthest extent possible.<br /><br />The Special Testing and Research Laboratory\u2019s Emerging Trends Program compiled the data for this report through a query of archived seizure and analysis information from drug evidence analyzed by the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s laboratory system. This data is representative of drug evidence seized and analyzed in the date ranges annotated. This is not a comprehensive list of all new psychoactive substances and is not representative of all evidence analyzed by DEA. This data is a quarterly snapshot of the new psychoactive substance market in the United States.<br /><br />Fentanyl is a Schedule II synthetic opioid originally developed to serve as both an analgesic (painkiller) and an anesthetic; however, its strong opioid properties have made it an attractive drug of abuse in the United States. Fentanyl, in its licit form, is diverted from the market on a small scale for personal use or sale. Illicitly manufactured and trafficked fentanyl is responsible for the current domestic crisis. Fentanyl, fentanyl-related compounds, and the precursor chemicals needed to produce these substances originate in China and transit Mexico or Canada enroute to U.S. markets. It is believed that illicit fentanyl manufacturing is occurring in Mexico. Moreover, small-scale production facilities have been discovered in the United States and Canada.<br /><br />The Special Testing and Research Laboratory\u2019s Emerging Trends Program compiled the data for this report through a query of archived seizure and analysis information from drug evidence analyzed by the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s laboratory system. This data is representative of drug evidence seized and analyzed in the date ranges annotated. This is not a comprehensive list of all new psychoactive substances and is not representative of all evidence analyzed by DEA. This data is a quarterly snapshot of the new psychoactive substance market in the United States.<br /><br />Open source platforms can be used by criminals to instigate or conduct illegal activity and by terrorists to recruit and encourage new members, disseminate violent extremist messaging through video or documents, coordinate activities, and claim responsibility for attacks around the world. As such, law enforcement and analytic personnel should understand the uses of social media and be aware of social media tools that can be used to document criminal and terrorist activity. A wide variety of open source analysis tools\u2014both no-cost and paid\u2014is available to public and private sector organizations, including law enforcement and analytic personnel, and the technology continues to evolve. ROSA tools that access only publicly available information and are capable of searching multiple platforms simultaneously are assets for maximizing efficiency during authorized uses by law enforcement and analytic personnel.<br /><br />Personal information is increasingly distributed online by the media, the public, law enforcement agencies, and even law enforcement personnel themselves. It is imperative that law enforcement personnel understand the importance and consequences of their online activities and be proactive in monitoring and limiting their digital footprint. What may seem like an innocent upload or shared post can have a significant effect not only on law enforcement personnel but on their departments, families, and friends. Law enforcement should take the steps now to protect themselves and their family members before becoming a victim.<br /><br />,Increased illicit use of opioids, including synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and its analogue carfentanil, is a source of increased risk to responders. Most routine encounters between patients or detainees and EMS or law enforcement do not present a significant threat of toxic exposure. While there are anecdotal reports of public safety personnel being exposed to opioids during operations, they are largely unconfirmed. To proactively address the potential risks, this document establishes guidance for personal protective equipment selection and use, decontamination, detection, and medical countermeasures for first responders who may be exposed to opioids in the course of their occupational activities. Throughout the remainder of this document, the term synthetic opioids will be used to include fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, morphine analogues, the U-series opioids, and others.<br /><br />This Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Intelligence Report contains information from a variety of law enforcement and open sources. It is designed as a ready reference for law enforcement personnel who are confronted by many of the hundreds of slang terms used to identify a wide variety of controlled substances, designer drugs, and synthetic compounds. Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information presented. However, due to the dynamics of the ever-changing drug scene, subsequent additions, deletions, and corrections are inevitable. Further addendums to this report will attempt to capture changed terminology, to the extent possible. This compendium of drug slang terms has been alphabetically ordered, and identifies drugs and drug categories in English and foreign language derivations.<br /><br />,The analysis of drug-related overdose death data plays a pivotal role in law enforcement\u2019s efforts to identify and combat drug suppliers, and ultimately drug abuse and related overdoses. At the most basic level, the drugs that contribute to death are an indicator of drug availability in the user market. Analysis of this data also highlights geographic patterns of abuse and identifies at-risk populations, and when coupled with drug treatment statistics, law enforcement drug seizure data, and public health indicators, allows for multi-disciplinary data-driven decisions regarding resource placement and strategic initiatives.<br /><br />,In January 2016, EPIC published Intelligence Note 02303-16a, this product provided analysis of data provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and open source reporting that indicated Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) continued to operate and profit from marijuana sales in legalized U.S. marijuana markets. EPIC research further showed that legalization of marijuana in some U.S. markets had not adversely impacted TCO profitability in marijuana markets, and that the effort of legalization had conversely brought new opportunities for illicit profits from marijuana sales. As of January 2017, EPIC research indicates that TCOs continue to exploit legalized marijuana markets in the United States.<br /><br />In the last several years, U.S. Law Enforcement has seen a dramatic increase in the availability of dangerous synthetic opioids. A large majority of these synthetic opioids are structural derivatives of the synthetic drug \u201cfentanyl.\u201d Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid currently listed as a Schedule II prescription drug that mimics the effects of morphine in the human body, but has potency 50\u2013100 times that of morphine. Due to the high potency and availability of fentanyl, both transnational and domestic criminal organizations are increasingly utilizing these dangerous synthetic opioids as an adulterant in heroin and other controlled substances. The presence of these synthetic opioids in the illicit U.S. drug market is extremely concerning as the potency of these drugs has led to a significant increase in overdose incidents and overdose-related deaths throughout the nation.<br /><br />A November 2016 presentation from the DEA detailing the rising popularity of heroin and opioid analgesics as well as the increasing death rates from overdose throughout the United States.<br /><br />,As a result of an extensive independent assessment of the San Francisco Police Department\u2019s (SFPD) activities and operations, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) presents findings and recommendations on how to address the agency\u2019s needs proactively in a long-term manner to improve trust between the SFPD and the communities it serves.<br /><br />This Presidential Policy Guidance (PPG) establishes the standard operating procedures for when the United States takes direct action, which refers to lethal and non-lethal uses of force, including capture operations, against terrorist targets outside the United States and areas of active hostilities.<br /><br />, , ,The procedures outlined in this document describe the current mechanisms through which the appropriate federal entities, as named in Section 102(3), share information with non-federal entities.<br /><br />,The abuse of illicit drugs, specifically heroin and cocaine, as well as the opioids fentanyl and oxycodone, has contributed to an increase in drug-related deaths in Philadelphia over the last decade. Specifically, drug-related overdose deaths in Philadelphia have risen 43 percent since 2009, with a corresponding 45 percent increase in heroin-positive toxicology test results.<br /><br />Mexican transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them. These Mexican poly-drug organizations traffic heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, and marijuana throughout the United States, using established transportation routes and distribution networks. They control drug trafficking across the Southwest Border and are moving to expand their share, particularly in the heroin and methamphetamine markets.<br /><br />DEA continues to identify eight major cartels currently operating in Mexico: Sinaloa, Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion (New Generation Jalisco Cartel or CJNG), Beltran-Leyva Organization (BLO), Los Zetas, Gulf, Juarez/La Linea, La Familia Michoacana (LFM), and Los Caballeros Templarios (Knights Templar or LCT); however, leadership losses for LFM and LCT over the last year have significantly degraded their operational capabilities and organizational cohesion. The attached graphic illustrates fluctuations in the areas of dominant control for Mexico\u2019s major DTOs, most notably the significant expansion of CJNG.<br /><br />Cell-site simulator technology provides valuable assistance in support of important public safety objectives. Whether deployed as part of a fugitive apprehension effort, a complex narcotics investigation, or to locate or rescue a kidnapped child, cell-site simulators fulfill critical operational needs. As with any law enforcement capability, the Department must use cell-site simulators in a manner that is consistent with the requirements and protections of the Constitution, including the Fourth Amendment, and applicable statutory authorities, including the Pen Register Statute. Moreover, any information resulting from the use of cell-site simulators must be handled in a way that is consistent with the array of applicable statutes, regulations, and policies that guide law enforcement in how it may and may not collect, retain, and disclose data.<br /><br />,Following the Office of the Inspector General\u2019s (OIG) April 2011 report on the FBI\u2019s ability to address the national cyber intrusion threat, in October 2012 the FBI launched its Next Generation Cyber (Next Gen Cyber) Initiative to enhance its ability to address cybersecurity threats to the United States. In fiscal year 2014, the FBI initially budgeted $314 million for its Next Gen Cyber Initiative, including a total of 1,333 full-time positions (including 756 agents). In addition, the Department of Justice (Department) requested an $86.6 million increase in funding for fiscal year 2014 to support the Initiative. The objective of this audit was to evaluate the FBI\u2019s implementation of its Next Gen Cyber Initiative.<br /><br />,Online radicalization to violence is the process by which an individual is introduced to an ideological message and belief system that encourages movement from mainstream beliefs toward extreme views, primarily through the use of online media, including social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. A result of radical interpretations of mainstream religious or political doctrines, these extreme views tend to justify, promote, incite, or support violence to achieve any number of social, religious, or political changes.<br /><br />Page 1 of 41<br /><br />\ufeffSearch for:<br /><br />Follow UsA D V E R T I S E M E N T<br /><br />Categories&bull;", "publish_time": 1569727278731, "collection_time": 1569727278731, "summary": "", "source": "publicintelligence"}
{"url": "https://publicintelligence.net/category/documents/united-states-documents/department-of-justice-united-states-documents-documents/", "title": "Department of Justice", "authors": "", "content": "The Internet Research Agency (IRA) carried out the earliest Russian interference operations identified by the investigation-a social media campaign designed to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States. The IRA was based in St. Petersburg, Russia, and received funding from Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Prigozhin and companies he controlled.  The IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to sow discord in the U.S. political system through what it termed information warfare. The campaign evolved from a generalized program designed in 2014 and 2015 to undermine the U.S. electoral system, to a targeted operation that by early 2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged candidate Clinton. The IRAs operation also included the purchase of political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities, as well as the staging of political rallies inside the United States. To organize those rallies, IRA employees posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and made contact with Trump supporters and Trump Campaign officials in the United States. The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated with the IRA. Section II of this report details the Offices investigation of the Russian social media campaign.<br /><br />Since its founding in 2012, the National Institute of Justice\u2019s Domestic Radicalization to Terrorism program has sponsored research on how radicalization to terrorism occurs in the United States in order to support prevention and intervention efforts. These projects have taken a variety of approaches to examining the process of radicalization to terrorism, but in spite of this there is substantial overlap in their findings, which collectively provide evidence of the importance of several facilitators of radicalization and the need to take into account how this process unfolds within individuals over time.<br /><br />As a result of the fundamental shift in communications services and technologies, criminal and national security investigations are unable to obtain needed evidence and intelligence despite having the legal authority to do so.<br /><br />The increasing demand for opioids in the United States coupled with the availability of fentanyl presents a significant public health risk and negatively impacts officer safety. In 2018, the Arizona High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) Counter Narcotics Alliance (CNA) task force seized tablets that appeared to be Xanax but actually contained a combination of cyclopropylfentanyl, methamphetamine, and a synthetic cannabinoid chemical.<br /><br />This Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Intelligence Report contains new and updated information on slang terms and code words from a variety of law enforcement and open sources, and serves as an updated version to the product entitled \u201cDrug Slang Code Words\u201d published by the DEA in May 2017. It is designed as a ready reference for law enforcement personnel who are confronted with hundreds of slang terms and code words used to identify a wide variety of controlled substances, designer drugs, synthetic compounds, measurements, locations, weapons, and other miscellaneous terms relevant to the drug trade. Although every effort was made to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information presented, due to the dynamics of the ever-changing drug scene, subsequent additions, deletions, and corrections are inevitable. Future addendums and updates to this report will attempt to capture changed terminology to the furthest extent possible.<br /><br />The Special Testing and Research Laboratory\u2019s Emerging Trends Program compiled the data for this report through a query of archived seizure and analysis information from drug evidence analyzed by the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s laboratory system. This data is representative of drug evidence seized and analyzed in the date ranges annotated. This is not a comprehensive list of all new psychoactive substances and is not representative of all evidence analyzed by DEA. This data is a quarterly snapshot of the new psychoactive substance market in the United States.<br /><br />Fentanyl is a Schedule II synthetic opioid originally developed to serve as both an analgesic (painkiller) and an anesthetic; however, its strong opioid properties have made it an attractive drug of abuse in the United States. Fentanyl, in its licit form, is diverted from the market on a small scale for personal use or sale. Illicitly manufactured and trafficked fentanyl is responsible for the current domestic crisis. Fentanyl, fentanyl-related compounds, and the precursor chemicals needed to produce these substances originate in China and transit Mexico or Canada enroute to U.S. markets. It is believed that illicit fentanyl manufacturing is occurring in Mexico. Moreover, small-scale production facilities have been discovered in the United States and Canada.<br /><br />The Special Testing and Research Laboratory\u2019s Emerging Trends Program compiled the data for this report through a query of archived seizure and analysis information from drug evidence analyzed by the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s laboratory system. This data is representative of drug evidence seized and analyzed in the date ranges annotated. This is not a comprehensive list of all new psychoactive substances and is not representative of all evidence analyzed by DEA. This data is a quarterly snapshot of the new psychoactive substance market in the United States.<br /><br />Open source platforms can be used by criminals to instigate or conduct illegal activity and by terrorists to recruit and encourage new members, disseminate violent extremist messaging through video or documents, coordinate activities, and claim responsibility for attacks around the world. As such, law enforcement and analytic personnel should understand the uses of social media and be aware of social media tools that can be used to document criminal and terrorist activity. A wide variety of open source analysis tools\u2014both no-cost and paid\u2014is available to public and private sector organizations, including law enforcement and analytic personnel, and the technology continues to evolve. ROSA tools that access only publicly available information and are capable of searching multiple platforms simultaneously are assets for maximizing efficiency during authorized uses by law enforcement and analytic personnel.<br /><br />Personal information is increasingly distributed online by the media, the public, law enforcement agencies, and even law enforcement personnel themselves. It is imperative that law enforcement personnel understand the importance and consequences of their online activities and be proactive in monitoring and limiting their digital footprint. What may seem like an innocent upload or shared post can have a significant effect not only on law enforcement personnel but on their departments, families, and friends. Law enforcement should take the steps now to protect themselves and their family members before becoming a victim.<br /><br />,Increased illicit use of opioids, including synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and its analogue carfentanil, is a source of increased risk to responders. Most routine encounters between patients or detainees and EMS or law enforcement do not present a significant threat of toxic exposure. While there are anecdotal reports of public safety personnel being exposed to opioids during operations, they are largely unconfirmed. To proactively address the potential risks, this document establishes guidance for personal protective equipment selection and use, decontamination, detection, and medical countermeasures for first responders who may be exposed to opioids in the course of their occupational activities. Throughout the remainder of this document, the term synthetic opioids will be used to include fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, morphine analogues, the U-series opioids, and others.<br /><br />This Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Intelligence Report contains information from a variety of law enforcement and open sources. It is designed as a ready reference for law enforcement personnel who are confronted by many of the hundreds of slang terms used to identify a wide variety of controlled substances, designer drugs, and synthetic compounds. Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information presented. However, due to the dynamics of the ever-changing drug scene, subsequent additions, deletions, and corrections are inevitable. Further addendums to this report will attempt to capture changed terminology, to the extent possible. This compendium of drug slang terms has been alphabetically ordered, and identifies drugs and drug categories in English and foreign language derivations.<br /><br />,The analysis of drug-related overdose death data plays a pivotal role in law enforcement\u2019s efforts to identify and combat drug suppliers, and ultimately drug abuse and related overdoses. At the most basic level, the drugs that contribute to death are an indicator of drug availability in the user market. Analysis of this data also highlights geographic patterns of abuse and identifies at-risk populations, and when coupled with drug treatment statistics, law enforcement drug seizure data, and public health indicators, allows for multi-disciplinary data-driven decisions regarding resource placement and strategic initiatives.<br /><br />,In January 2016, EPIC published Intelligence Note 02303-16a, this product provided analysis of data provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and open source reporting that indicated Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) continued to operate and profit from marijuana sales in legalized U.S. marijuana markets. EPIC research further showed that legalization of marijuana in some U.S. markets had not adversely impacted TCO profitability in marijuana markets, and that the effort of legalization had conversely brought new opportunities for illicit profits from marijuana sales. As of January 2017, EPIC research indicates that TCOs continue to exploit legalized marijuana markets in the United States.<br /><br />In the last several years, U.S. Law Enforcement has seen a dramatic increase in the availability of dangerous synthetic opioids. A large majority of these synthetic opioids are structural derivatives of the synthetic drug \u201cfentanyl.\u201d Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid currently listed as a Schedule II prescription drug that mimics the effects of morphine in the human body, but has potency 50\u2013100 times that of morphine. Due to the high potency and availability of fentanyl, both transnational and domestic criminal organizations are increasingly utilizing these dangerous synthetic opioids as an adulterant in heroin and other controlled substances. The presence of these synthetic opioids in the illicit U.S. drug market is extremely concerning as the potency of these drugs has led to a significant increase in overdose incidents and overdose-related deaths throughout the nation.<br /><br />A November 2016 presentation from the DEA detailing the rising popularity of heroin and opioid analgesics as well as the increasing death rates from overdose throughout the United States.<br /><br />,As a result of an extensive independent assessment of the San Francisco Police Department\u2019s (SFPD) activities and operations, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) presents findings and recommendations on how to address the agency\u2019s needs proactively in a long-term manner to improve trust between the SFPD and the communities it serves.<br /><br />This Presidential Policy Guidance (PPG) establishes the standard operating procedures for when the United States takes direct action, which refers to lethal and non-lethal uses of force, including capture operations, against terrorist targets outside the United States and areas of active hostilities.<br /><br />, , ,The procedures outlined in this document describe the current mechanisms through which the appropriate federal entities, as named in Section 102(3), share information with non-federal entities.<br /><br />,The abuse of illicit drugs, specifically heroin and cocaine, as well as the opioids fentanyl and oxycodone, has contributed to an increase in drug-related deaths in Philadelphia over the last decade. Specifically, drug-related overdose deaths in Philadelphia have risen 43 percent since 2009, with a corresponding 45 percent increase in heroin-positive toxicology test results.<br /><br />Mexican transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them. These Mexican poly-drug organizations traffic heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, and marijuana throughout the United States, using established transportation routes and distribution networks. They control drug trafficking across the Southwest Border and are moving to expand their share, particularly in the heroin and methamphetamine markets.<br /><br />DEA continues to identify eight major cartels currently operating in Mexico: Sinaloa, Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion (New Generation Jalisco Cartel or CJNG), Beltran-Leyva Organization (BLO), Los Zetas, Gulf, Juarez/La Linea, La Familia Michoacana (LFM), and Los Caballeros Templarios (Knights Templar or LCT); however, leadership losses for LFM and LCT over the last year have significantly degraded their operational capabilities and organizational cohesion. The attached graphic illustrates fluctuations in the areas of dominant control for Mexico\u2019s major DTOs, most notably the significant expansion of CJNG.<br /><br />Cell-site simulator technology provides valuable assistance in support of important public safety objectives. Whether deployed as part of a fugitive apprehension effort, a complex narcotics investigation, or to locate or rescue a kidnapped child, cell-site simulators fulfill critical operational needs. As with any law enforcement capability, the Department must use cell-site simulators in a manner that is consistent with the requirements and protections of the Constitution, including the Fourth Amendment, and applicable statutory authorities, including the Pen Register Statute. Moreover, any information resulting from the use of cell-site simulators must be handled in a way that is consistent with the array of applicable statutes, regulations, and policies that guide law enforcement in how it may and may not collect, retain, and disclose data.<br /><br />,Following the Office of the Inspector General\u2019s (OIG) April 2011 report on the FBI\u2019s ability to address the national cyber intrusion threat, in October 2012 the FBI launched its Next Generation Cyber (Next Gen Cyber) Initiative to enhance its ability to address cybersecurity threats to the United States. In fiscal year 2014, the FBI initially budgeted $314 million for its Next Gen Cyber Initiative, including a total of 1,333 full-time positions (including 756 agents).

Gen. Dash Jamieson, Air Force deputy chief of staff for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and cyber effects operations, said Wednesday. \u201cFlight plans and strategies are about prioritization and putting our money where our mouth is in resourcing. We actually have a signed plan that says Let\u2019s talk about it upfront, let\u2019s invest in our people, lets invest in our training, let\u2019s invest in our capabilities.\u201d<br /><br />The Cyber Flight Plan is scant on public details. The Air Force boiled down the plan to a single trifold brochure, which is all the service intends to publish in an unclassified format, she said.<br /><br />There is a more detailed plan at different classification levelsbut that will not be out for public consumption, because we are in persistent and continuous competition with our adversaries who would want to know what is our roadmap, she told reporters.<br /><br />Advertisement<br /><br />But it does identify seven areas of importance and three lines of effort.<br /><br />One of the most emphasized of those is human capital, which is an area of importance and part of the foundational capabilities line of effort.<br /><br />Jamieson explained as part of that effort the Air Force honed its cyber career tracks to give officers more control over their development.<br /><br />One field is for offensive and defensive operators and the other is for expeditionary warfighting communications and communications maintenance.<br /><br />\u201cThere are hundreds of ways of how you can develop, train and chart your own path,\u201d Jamieson said at an Air Force Association event in National Harbor, Md. \u201cEvery airman deserves the ability and right to define success for them.\u201d<br /><br />By the end of September, cyber officers will input their experience, training and desire to choose which career path they prefer.<br /><br />The Air Force is working on the same thing for enlisted and civilian cyber employees.<br /><br />\u201cThe plan starts with human capital,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Bradley Pyburn, Air Force director of cyberspace operations and warfighter communications. \u201cWe have to be able to recruit, retain and develop talent in this battle space.\u201d<br /><br />Other areas of importance include accelerating emerging technologies, coming up with low cost options for defensive cyber operations, expanding offensive cyber capabilities and providing resilient communications.<br /><br />The other lines of effort focus on emerging technologies and readiness.<br /><br />\u201cWith emerging technology, the technology we have today is not going to be the technology we have next week, next month or tomorrow and we have to be agile and we have to move quickly,\u201d Pyburn said.<br /><br />The readiness effort stresses modernizing capabilities and growing offensive and defensive cyber operation capabilities.<br /><br />The plan comes as the service plans to  its 24th Air Force and 25th Air Force \u2014 Air Forces Cyber and Air Force Intelligence, respectively \u2014 into the . The 16th Air Force will also be known as Air Force Information Warfare. Maj. Gen. Timothy Haught is nominated to lead the new organization.<br /><br />Air Force officials say the 16th will bring cyber and intelligence experts under one roof so they can better act in unison and share information quicker.<br /><br />\u201cThe merger of 24th and 25th is the next step in leveraging and integrating new ideas and technologies to both improve the quality and speed of decision-making and deliver improved effects for commanders,\u201d said Gen. Mike Holmes, commander of Air Combat Command. \u201cThis formalizes the existing collaborations between cyber and ISR while expanding our competitive space in electronic warfare and information operations, ultimately improving readiness and increasing lethality across the range of military operations \u2014 all vital to the success of multi-domain warfighting in the 21st century.\u201d<br /><br />Copyright &copy;2019 Federal News Network.

Kennedy International Airport.<br /><br />According to a probable-cause statement, the package came from Delta Shipping, a repeat-seizure violator identified with over 300 seizures of narcotics, and import-history research and records checks link Silcox to at least eight seizures of drugs, including Tramadol, Modafinil and cocaine, headed to Bay Area post-office boxes.<br /><br />Officers at the postal services San Francisco airmail facility intercepted another 650 200-milligram tablet Tramadol package from Singapore on August 28, before receiving another package Sept. 13 that held 458 grams of Tramadol.<br /><br />After law enforcement officers swapped out the August packages Tramadol for substitute material, they delivered it to Silcoxs post office box Monday. He picked up the package the same day, and officers arrested him Tuesday at his Coast Guard Island residence.<br /><br />In an interview at that time, Silcox told a Homeland Security Investigations officer that he began purchasing Tramadol online two years ago from a person he believed was based in Singapore. When agents received consent to search Silcoxs car, they found Tramadol pills and the swapped substitute material from the earlier shipment.<br /><br />Silcox was released on a personal recognizance bond after appearing in San Francisco federal court Wednesday morning, and he will return Sept. 26 to identify counsel and attend a preliminary hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Kandis Westmore.<br /><br />He faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each violation, but federal sentencing guidelines will ultimately affect any imposed sentence.<br /><br />Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah Griswold is prosecuting the case, which came from an investigation by the Homeland Security Investigations; the High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area-Transnational Narcotics Team; the U.S. Postal Inspection Service; the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General; and the Coast Guard Investigation Service.<br /><br />Contact George Kelly at 408-859-5180.<br /><br />Tags:George Kelly is a breaking news reporter for the Bay Area News Group.

The sensors respond immediately as soon as someone tries to climb over or cut through the fence, providing information on the precise location of the securitybreach.<br /><br />Infrastructure protectionUsing data mining, data fusion, and what are known as \u201crule based engines,\u201d the EU-funded ARGOS, which stands for Advanced Protection of Critical Buildings by Overhauling Anticipating Systems, has developed an innovative early warning security system for critical infrastructure facilities, letting site operators know whether there is a potential threat. The rule-based engines allow operators to \u201cteach\u201d the system what alarms are true enabling systems to \u2018learn\u2019 and improve over time. The early warning systems extend the sites\u2019 \u201csecurity zone\u201d and helps vital infrastructure to become more secure againstintruders.<br /><br />Nuclear operationsRetired Air Force lieutenant-general and now National Nuclear Security Administration(NNSA) chief Frank Klotz asserted last week that security at the Y-12 National Security Complexat Oak Ridge National Laboratory(ORNL) has improved significantly since a 28 July 2012 break-inat the plant when three aging peace activists, led by an 82-year old nun, managed to breach the facility\u2019s supposedly impregnable perimeter securitysystems.<br /><br />Security guardsDespite playing a more important role in the wake of 9/11, the security guard industry remains plagued by inadequate training and standards in many states, new study of the $7 billion-a-year industry finds. Formal training of the nation\u2019s one million-plus private security officers is widely neglected, a surprising finding when contrasted with other private occupations such as paramedics, childcare workers, and evencosmetologists.<br /><br />Nuclear facilitiesKirk Garland, a security guard at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, was fired from his job two weeks after three aging peace activists, led by an 82-year old nun, managed, on 28 July 2012, to breach the facility\u2019s supposedly impregnable perimeter security systems, then loiter, unnoticed, on the grounds of the facility, where bomb grade uranium is stored. The activists had enough time to spray-paint peace messages and Bible verses on walls, slosh the walls with human blood, and wrap one of the buildings with crime-scene tape. In an arbitration hearing, Garland argued that he was made a scapegoat for the larger failings of the then-security contractor,WackenhutServices.<br /><br />Airport perimeter securityLast months security breach at Mineta San Jose Airport, in which a teenager entered the airfield and hid in the wheel well of a Maui-bound flight, has highlighted concerns about the security of airport perimeters. Perimeter intrusions are common at airports, but airports resist pressures to improve perimeter protection because of the costs involved. Experts note that if we were to string all of the U.S. airport perimeters together, we would approach the length of the U.S. border with Mexico and security expenditures approaching a billion dollars. These experts say that airports are not likely to invest heavily in perimeter security until a serious disaster due to lax perimeter security occurs. Show me a body count, and well build a fence, said one airportadministrator.<br /><br />Nuclear facilities securityBy Robert Lee MarilJudge Amul R. Thapar sentenced three peace protestors who breached the Y-12 Nuclear Security Complex at Y-12 National Security Complexat Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to lengthy sentences in federal prison. Judge Thapar stated that he did not believe the three defendants  Sister Megan Rice, 84. Michael R. Walli, 65, and Greg Boertje-Obed, 59  were terrorists but, nevertheless, they had broken the law and must serve sentences which demonstrated that the law should be taken seriously.To reach the Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility (HEUMF) building at Y-12, the three peace activists, led by the octogenarian Sister Rice, cut through four fences and escaped detection by security guards authorized to use lethal force, and by ground sensors, sophisticated surveillance cameras, and other security equipment described by Y-12 as \u201c\u2026the most stringent security system in theworld.\u201d<br /><br />Infrastructure protectionThere are about 45,000 substations in the United States, but far fewer high-voltage substations like the one attacked last April in Metcalf. California. Americans could see what the loss of just one important power substation can have when, in 2003, a failure in one such substation knocked out power to fifty million people in the United States and Canada for days. Illinois-based IDT says that since Biblical times, the method of thick-walled fortifications to halt manned and artillery attacks remains the best technology for protecting lives and important assets. The company says that its METALITH, a several-feet-thick prefabricated steel barrier structure filled with sand, would offer the best protection to vulnerable power substations. While most of the electrical industry has been focused on the threat of cyber-terrorism, the San Jose [Metcalf is near San Jose] attack points to the need for physical protection of strategic power grid assets as well, says Tom Carlton, IDT\u2019sCEO.<br /><br />Perimeter protectionHigh-security compounds have traditionally employed security guards to protect buildings and facilities, deter intrusion, and prevent theft, but as budget cuts continue to force both private and government organizations to cut staff, some agencies are deploying portable barrier systems and robots tasked with securing organizations and theirassets.<br /><br />Nuclear weaponsPolice officers of the U.K. Ministry of Defense police, assigned to guard Britains nuclear weapons, are under investigation after it has been reported that they had slept on the job and failed to complete routine patrols at a nuclear weapons facility. The Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) in Burghfield, Berkshire, is the location of the complex final assembly of nuclear weapons, and also where the U.K. nuclear warheads are maintained anddecommissioned.<br /><br />Nuclear facilities securityBy Robert Lee MarilOn 28 July 2012, three senior citizens, led by an 83-year old nun, easily breached the supposedly impregnable security systems protecting the Y-12 National Security Complex at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The three peace activists wondered the grounds of the maximum security facility for a while before being noticed by security personnel. While the three aging protesters are awaiting sentencing, the two companies  Bechtel Corporation and Babcock and Wilcox \u2013 which were responsible for designing and implementing security at Y-12, have been named as the primary construction contractors for planning and design of the new uranium processing facility (UPF) to be built atY-12.<br /><br />DetectionAround a military camp situated close to a built-up area there are always people moving about.

Earlier this month, the Treasury Department issued proposed regulations, upping national security scrutiny of foreign investment deals that involve data, technologies and infrastructure. And the stakes on CFIUS can be high, as shown when the Trump administration in 2017 nixed a $1.3 billion semiconductor deal involving a Chinese company with state ties.The administration cited national security concerns in scuttling the deal. Going forward, expanded government scrutiny \u201cis likely to include deals involving access to health data, financial information and behavioral data,\u201d said Lee Wolosky, a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner, who served on the National Security Council under two presidents.In response to client demand, Boies Schiller plans to start a national security practice in coming weeks, Wolosky said. Initially, the firm will use its existing lawyers but could expand.Making MovesOften expertise in government enforcement and on the growing issues of cybersecurity and data privacy\u2014another hot topic for clients\u2014can also be found in hires with national security backgrounds.O\u2019Melveny has built its ranks by adding prominent former government officials in its data security and privacy practice. They include partners Bunnell and this year, Lisa Monaco, former homeland security and counterterrorism adviser to President Barack Obama, and firm counsel John Dermody, a former deputy legal adviser at the National Security Council.Mark Jensen, managing partner of King &amp; Spalding\u2019s Washington office, noted that his firm has hired several new laterals. One is former FBI official Sumon Dantiki, whose national security credentials Jensen called \u201cimpeccable.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s part of the package we offer companies in how to protect their data and technologies from global cybersecurity threats,\u201d Jensen added.Morrison &amp; Foerster said it, too, had been bulking up national security offerings with senior lateral hires. In recent years, the firm has added four partners, including John Carlin, former assistant attorney general at the Justice Department\u2019s national security division.Trisha Anderson, a former high-ranking FBI official who handled complex national security and cyber legal issues, last year rejoined Covington &amp; Burling as a partner focusing on national security and related matters.To contact the reporter on this story: Elizabeth Olson in Washington at To contact the editors responsible for this story: Jessie Kokrda Kamens at ; Rebekah Mintzer at<br /><br />Elizabeth Olson<br /><br />Special Correspondent\u00a9 2019 The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc.All Rights Reserved<br /><br />", "publish_time": 1569727221918, "collection_time": 1569727221918, "summary": "Large law firms have stepped up hiring of lawyers with national security backgrounds to address emerging client concerns, as geopolitical uncertainty continues and raises new and vexing questions for companies\u2019 operations.", "source": "\u56fd\u571f\u5b89\u5168\u65b0\u95fb"}

Initially, the firm will use its existing lawyers but could expand.Making MovesOften expertise in government enforcement and on the growing issues of cybersecurity and data privacy\u2014another hot topic for clients\u2014can also be found in hires with national security backgrounds.O\u2019Melveny has built its ranks by adding prominent former government officials in its data security and privacy practice. They include partners Bunnell and this year, Lisa Monaco, former homeland security and counterterrorism adviser to President Barack Obama, and firm counsel John Dermody, a former deputy legal adviser at the National Security Council.Mark Jensen, managing partner of King &amp; Spalding\u2019s Washington office, noted that his firm has hired several new laterals.

In two of the infected organizations, the attackers obtained domain-level administrative access, so the attackers had access to all machines on those networks.<br /><br />The researchers say Tortoiseshell does not appear to be related to any existing groups in the Middle East.

Charming Kitten is best known for targeting victims in the US, Israel, and the UK who work in the academic research, human rights, and media industries.<br /><br />It's unclear what the overlap means; nation-stage groups sometimes share or reuse others' tools. And, as Symantec and other security researchers note, attribution gets harder all the time as these groups get more sophisticated.<br /><br />Bambenek says Iran is likely to continue expanding its cyber espionage and other hacking operations even in the wake of the latest economic sanctions by the US. Cyber operations are relatively inexpensive, he notes.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's oil and gas industry long has been a major cyber target for Iran, starting with its data-destruction attack on Saudi Aramco in 2012, as well as the infamous Shamoon and Triton attacks.

The number of supply chain attacks jumped 78% in 2018, according to Symantec's data. \"IT providers are an ideal target for attackers given their high level of access to their clients' computers.

Lately, however, there are signs that Tehran has shifted to a strategy driven instead by a sense of opportunity and advantage. Kenneth M. Pollack writes in  that the trigger for this shift has been the Trump administration, whose misguided approach to Iran is on the cusp of splitting the United States from its Sunni Arab allies\u2014a monumental geostrategic victory that Tehran has sought for 40years.<br /><br />Pollack writes that initially, Iran\u2019s attacks on Gulf oil exports were almost certainly driven by fear and anger over the impact of the reimposed U.S. sanctions, which are devastating Iran\u2019s economy and inflicting real hardship on average Iranians. The regime, even its hard-line elements, probably feared this would generate public protests and other problems for it. Tehran\u2019s attacks on Gulf oil exports were likely meant to drive up the price of oil (which would be good for Iran, bad for the United States) and to create a crisis that would energize other countries to demand that Washington ease off the pressure on Iran. Iran\u2019s attacks on the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries were initially intended as a form of indirect pressure on the United States to get it to alleviate, or even eliminate, thesanctions.<br /><br />Pollackwrites:<br /><br />That Iranian strategy has failed miserably. While their attacks did create crises, only the recent strike on Abqaiq caused any significant jump in oil prices, and even that was probably less than the Iranians had hoped. Meanwhile, in part because the oil market has remained mostly placid, the Iranian strategy has had no impact on U.S. policy, either directly or indirectly by moving Arab, Asian, and European countries to persuade Washington to backoff.<br /><br />At the same time, however, the Iranian attacks have succeeded wildly in a way that Tehran probably never imagined. Because the United States has barely responded at all\u2014only applying more fatuous sanctions and a single cyberattack that Iran seems to have shaken off\u2014and because senior U.S. officials starting with the president have trumpeted that they will not employ force unless Iran attacks American citizens or property directly, the Iranian attacks have driven a lethal wedge between the United States and theGCC.<br /><br />Although this has been part of a larger, longer process of the Sunni Arab states losing faith in their long-standing relationship with the United States, recent developments have had an outsized impact, dramatically accelerating that process. We may well have reached a tipping point, as Foreign Policy\u2019s Steven A.

These are common traits for involvement in cybercrime, among other delinquencies. New  from Michigan State University identified characteristics and gender-specific behaviors in kids that could lead them to become juvenilehackers.<br /><br />\u201cWe know much about the scope of hacking and its threat, but the problem is that we don\u2019t know exactly when and how hacking behavior starts,\u201d said Thomas Holt, lead author and MSU cybercrime expert in the School of Criminal Justice. \u201cThere is a general understanding that hacking starts in the early teens but until now, we weren\u2019t clear on background factors, such as behavioral issues, the impact of social connections or personality traits. Our findings pointed us in the direction of thinking that there are gendered pathways tohacking.\u201d<br /><br />MSU  that Holt assessed responses from 50,000 teens from around the world to determine predictors of hacking. The findings, published in Crime &amp; Delinquency, are the first to dig into gendered differences from a global dataset.<br /><br />\u201cWe found that predictors of juvenile delinquency, like low self-control \u2013 so, not having the ability to hold back when opportunity presents itself \u2013 are big factors for computer hacking for both boys and girls,\u201d Holt said. \u201cBut for girls, peer associations mattered more. If she has friends who shoplift or engage in petty forms of crime, she\u2019s more likely to be influenced to hack as well. For boys, we found that time spent watching TV or playing computer games were associated withhacking.\u201d<br /><br />Holt explained that the stark differences between boys and girls were quite distinct, reinforcing the idea that girls get into hacking in ways that greatly differ from boys. He said that some of the findings play to how kids are raised within gender roles, such as letting boys play video games and giving girls differentactivities.<br /><br />For boys and girls, simply having opportunities to hack were significant in starting such behavior.This could include having their own bedroom, their own computer or the freedom of doing what they want on the internet without parentalsupervision.<br /><br />While most schools have computer and internet access, Holt explained that there are still some geographic barriers for kids to enter cybercrime. The researchers found that kids who had mobile phone access early on were more likely to hack \u2013 especially if they lived in larger cities. Spending time with peers was more likely to influence delinquent behavior for those living in smaller cities. The researchers also found a connection between pirating movies and music andhacking.<br /><br />In the 1980s and 1990s, juvenile hacking was mostly limited to gaming purposes, and even now most initial cybercrime isn\u2019t serious, such as getting into Facebook or email accounts, Holtsaid.<br /><br />\u201cThe initial attempts might not be serious, but without supervision and low self-control, it\u2019s likely they got a taste for what they might be able to accomplish by taking their hacking abilities further,\u201d Holt said. \u201cAnd while low self-control plays a huge role with kids and teens, some of them mature as they age and can sit for hours, which gives them time to refine the skills of a sophisticatedhacker.\u201d<br /><br />It\u2019s important for parents to understand their kids\u2019 tech-savviness and habits to help guide them on a path that uses their skills in a more positiveway.<br /><br />\u201cParents shouldn\u2019t assume that having a kid with sophisticated technological competency is always totally fine,\u201d Holt said. \u201cFinding others in the field \u2013 like those you\u2019d meet in a robotics club or attending something like the DefCon conference \u2013 is vital for kids to learn about using their skills in a positive way and for staving off bad behaviors,\u201d Holt said. \u201cCybercrime can be a hidden problem, so talking is vital. The more you can understand what they\u2019re doing, the easier you can flag something that might be off and curtailactivity.\u201d<br /><br />Share|", "publish_time": 1569727150997, "collection_time": 1569727150998, "summary": "\u201cWe found that predictors of juvenile delinquency, like low self-control \u2013 so, not having the ability to hold back when opportunity presents itself \u2013 are big factors for computer hacking for both boys and girls,\u201d Holt said.", "source": "\u56fd\u571f\u5b89\u5168\u65b0\u95fb"}

American innovations in these fields since the late 1960s have led the world into a new technological era and opened countless practical capabilities and opportunities on which the security and prosperity of the United States today depend. Also vital to the Nation&rsquo;s prosperity and security are IT advancements that mitigate potential risks posed by adversarial breaches of the country&rsquo;s increasingly interwoven IT-based operations.<br /><br />As IT capabilities and applications began to advance vigorously in the 1980s, the U.S. Congress recognized the urgency of coordinating federally funded networking and information technology research and development (R&amp;D) to effectively channel public investments in these technologies. Congress established the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program in the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 and has reauthorized it three times, most recently in 2017 by the . The NITRD Program&rsquo;s charge is to help coordinate R&amp;D by Federal agencies to efficiently identify, develop, and transition into practical use the advanced networking and IT capabilities needed by the Federal Government and the Nation.<br /><br />The NITRD Program currently coordinates the IT R&amp;D activities of 24 Federal agency members and over 45 other participating agencies with program interests and activities in IT R&amp;D. The Program is managed by the NITRD Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council&rsquo;s Committee on Science and Technology Enterprise, with day-to-day support from its National Coordination Office (NCO). As required by legislation, NITRD and NCO must annually compile and send to Congress a Supplement to the President&rsquo;s Budget that provides the NITRD-relevant R&amp;D budgets requested by member agencies and that details key agency R&amp;D programs and coordination activities.<br /><br />The President and Congress continue to recognize the seminal value to the security and prosperity of the United States of leading the world in IT innovations and applications. The FY2020 NITRD R&amp;D Budget focuses on R&amp;D investment and coordination in pivotal IT-related technologies that support the leading industries of the future - a core science and technology (S&amp;T) investment focus of the Administration. It defines these industries of the future and their associated technologies as . All of these have significant IT components that relate directly to the NITRD Program&rsquo;s R&amp;D coordination mission. American success in these trailblazing fields will rely on both basic and applications-driven research; ongoing support for the R&amp;D infrastructure; public-private R&amp;D partnerships (PPPs) across the U.S. innovation ecosystem; and effective education of the American public and workers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.<br /><br />NITRD Interagency Working Groups (IWGs) and their participating agencies&rsquo; Program Component Area (PCA) investments work directly and indirectly to support the Administration&rsquo;s priority to advance IT technologies into practical use in the cutting-edge industries of the future.<br /><br />In response to Executive Order 13859,  and in support of , this NITRD Budget Supplement reports for the first time a summary of Federal investments in AI (except for DoD and DARPA investment levels, which were not available). Since artificial intelligence as a topic intersects with multiple PCAs, NITRD worked with the Federal agencies to establish a new process for accurately accounting for these AI investments.

Researchers are increasingly using machine learning (ML) not only for data analytics but also for modeling and simulation; science-based simulations are increasingly relying on embedded ML models not only to interpret results from massive data outputs but also to steer computations. Science-based models are being combined with data-driven models to represent complex systems and phenomena. There also is an increasing need for real-time data analytics, which requires large-scale computations to be performed closer to the data and data infrastructures, to adapt to HPC-like modes of operation. These new use cases create a vital need for HPC and BD systems to deal with simulations and data analytics in a more unified fashion.<br /><br />To explore this need, the NITRD  and  Interagency Working Groups held a workshop, The Convergence of High-Performance Computing, Big Data, and Machine Learning, on October 29-30, 2018, in Bethesda, Maryland. The purposes of the workshop were to bring together representatives from the public, private, and academic sectors to share their knowledge and insights on integrating HPC, BD, and ML systems and approaches and to identify key research challenges and opportunities. The 58 workshop participants represented a balanced cross-section of stakeholders involved in or impacted by this area of research. Additional workshop information, including a webcast, is available at .<br /><br />From the presentations and discussions, a vision emerged of a rich computational ecosystem consisting of heterogeneous combinations of edge, cloud, and high performance computing systems. This ecosystem would be flexible and be able to receive data from a variety of sources such as scientific and medical instruments, sensor networks, and security and infrastructure monitoring systems. It would have edge Internet of Things devices that would extract important features and convert data into forms suitable for ingesting and storing in the cloud. Large-scale data analytics would run in the cloud, combining ingested data with stored databases. HPC systems would perform more computationally intensive forms of analysis and optimization, as well as run simulations for predictive modeling.<br /><br />Such a rich computing environment could provide capabilities well beyond those of today&rsquo;s isolated systems. For biomedical and clinical research and healthcare, it would enable the use of clinical, laboratory, and even molecular data for patients and for researchers. Data sources could include smart health applications where patient outcomes are connected to an evidence-based computed model, thereby putting data as a &ldquo;digital first&rdquo; asset in the healthcare system. The computing environment would allow scientific and medical researchers to solve problems with many degrees of freedom in ways that allow data to inform models and simulations to build better models.<br /><br />Achieving this vision of a rich computing ecosystem will require new capabilities in hardware (computing, network, and storage); management modes of operation; and software. Providing true convergence among current and future computing environments presents many technical and organization challenges, but it could provide capabilities in scientific research, national security, healthcare, and industry well beyond what is possible today.<br /><br />View Full Text:<br /><br />September 9, 2019<br /><br />View Full Text:<br /><br />The Future Computing (FC) Community of Interest (CoI) meeting on August 5&ndash;6, 2019, explored the evolving computing landscape to inform agencies about potential opportunities as well as gaps in the Nation&rsquo;s future computing objectives. The meeting focused on where computing will be in the next decade and beyond while also looking at emerging and future applications. It considered the need for new software concepts and approaches to effectively capitalize on new hardware architectures and paradigms. The long period of sustained growth in computing power over the last five decades, characterized by Moore&rsquo;s Law and Dennard Scaling, is expected to end over the next decade. The continued improvement in computing performance will now require moving to new modalities and new means of cooperation and partnership for the benefit of the Nation.<br /><br />The FC-CoI meeting was held at the offices of the Federal Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program in Washington, D.C. The meeting brought together key members of industry, academia, and the Federal Government over a two-day period to discuss the future of computing. The meeting had been advertised in the Federal Register to encourage broad participation from the advanced computing community.

American innovations in these fields since the late 1960s have led the world into a new technological era and opened countless practical capabilities and opportunities on which the security and prosperity of the United States today depend. Also vital to the Nation&rsquo;s prosperity and security are IT advancements that mitigate potential risks posed by adversarial breaches of the country&rsquo;s increasingly interwoven IT-based operations.<br /><br />As IT capabilities and applications began to advance vigorously in the 1980s, the U.S. Congress recognized the urgency of coordinating federally funded networking and information technology research and development (R&amp;D) to effectively channel public investments in these technologies. Congress established the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program in the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 and has reauthorized it three times, most recently in 2017 by the . The NITRD Program&rsquo;s charge is to help coordinate R&amp;D by Federal agencies to efficiently identify, develop, and transition into practical use the advanced networking and IT capabilities needed by the Federal Government and the Nation.<br /><br />The NITRD Program currently coordinates the IT R&amp;D activities of 24 Federal agency members and over 45 other participating agencies with program interests and activities in IT R&amp;D. The Program is managed by the NITRD Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council&rsquo;s Committee on Science and Technology Enterprise, with day-to-day support from its National Coordination Office (NCO). As required by legislation, NITRD and NCO must annually compile and send to Congress a Supplement to the President&rsquo;s Budget that provides the NITRD-relevant R&amp;D budgets requested by member agencies and that details key agency R&amp;D programs and coordination activities.<br /><br />The President and Congress continue to recognize the seminal value to the security and prosperity of the United States of leading the world in IT innovations and applications. The FY2020 NITRD R&amp;D Budget focuses on R&amp;D investment and coordination in pivotal IT-related technologies that support the leading industries of the future - a core science and technology (S&amp;T) investment focus of the Administration. It defines these industries of the future and their associated technologies as . All of these have significant IT components that relate directly to the NITRD Program&rsquo;s R&amp;D coordination mission. American success in these trailblazing fields will rely on both basic and applications-driven research; ongoing support for the R&amp;D infrastructure; public-private R&amp;D partnerships (PPPs) across the U.S. innovation ecosystem; and effective education of the American public and workers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.<br /><br />NITRD Interagency Working Groups (IWGs) and their participating agencies&rsquo; Program Component Area (PCA) investments work directly and indirectly to support the Administration&rsquo;s priority to advance IT technologies into practical use in the cutting-edge industries of the future.<br /><br />In response to Executive Order 13859,  and in support of , this NITRD Budget Supplement reports for the first time a summary of Federal investments in AI (except for DoD and DARPA investment levels, which were not available). Since artificial intelligence as a topic intersects with multiple PCAs, NITRD worked with the Federal agencies to establish a new process for accurately accounting for these AI investments.

The four strategic defensive elements of the strategic plan consist of Deter, Protect, Detect, and Adapt, as defined below:<br /><br />Deter: The ability to efficiently discourage malicious cyber activities by measuring and increasing the costs to adversaries who carry out such activities, diminishing their spoils, and increasing risks and uncertainty of consequences for cyber attacks.<br /><br />Protect: The ability of components, systems, users, and critical infrastructure to efficiently resist malicious cyber activities and to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability, and accountability.<br /><br />Detect: The ability to efficiently detect, and even anticipate, adversary decisions and activities, given that perfect security is not possible and systems should be assumed to be vulnerable to malicious cyber activities.<br /><br />Adapt: The ability of defenders, defenses, and infrastructure to dynamically adapt to malicious cyber activities by efficiently reacting to disruption, recovering from damage, maintaining operations while completing restoration, and adjusting to be able to thwart similar future activity.<br /><br />The FY2020 Implementation Roadmap, which accompanies the, maps the Federal agency programs across these four areas.<br /><br />View Full Text:<br /><br />To learn more about the Cyber Security and Information Assurance (CSIA) Interagency Working Group (IWG) please visit<br /><br />September 9, 2019<br /><br />View Full Text:<br /><br />The high performance computing (HPC) and big data (BD) communities are evolving in response to changing user needs and technological landscapes. Researchers are increasingly using machine learning (ML) not only for data analytics but also for modeling and simulation; science-based simulations are increasingly relying on embedded ML models not only to interpret results from massive data outputs but also to steer computations. Science-based models are being combined with data-driven models to represent complex systems and phenomena. There also is an increasing need for real-time data analytics, which requires large-scale computations to be performed closer to the data and data infrastructures, to adapt to HPC-like modes of operation. These new use cases create a vital need for HPC and BD systems to deal with simulations and data analytics in a more unified fashion.<br /><br />To explore this need, the NITRD  and  Interagency Working Groups held a workshop, The Convergence of High-Performance Computing, Big Data, and Machine Learning, on October 29-30, 2018, in Bethesda, Maryland. The purposes of the workshop were to bring together representatives from the public, private, and academic sectors to share their knowledge and insights on integrating HPC, BD, and ML systems and approaches and to identify key research challenges and opportunities. The 58 workshop participants represented a balanced cross-section of stakeholders involved in or impacted by this area of research. Additional workshop information, including a webcast, is available at .<br /><br />From the presentations and discussions, a vision emerged of a rich computational ecosystem consisting of heterogeneous combinations of edge, cloud, and high performance computing systems. This ecosystem would be flexible and be able to receive data from a variety of sources such as scientific and medical instruments, sensor networks, and security and infrastructure monitoring systems. It would have edge Internet of Things devices that would extract important features and convert data into forms suitable for ingesting and storing in the cloud. Large-scale data analytics would run in the cloud, combining ingested data with stored databases. HPC systems would perform more computationally intensive forms of analysis and optimization, as well as run simulations for predictive modeling.<br /><br />Such a rich computing environment could provide capabilities well beyond those of today&rsquo;s isolated systems. For biomedical and clinical research and healthcare, it would enable the use of clinical, laboratory, and even molecular data for patients and for researchers. Data sources could include smart health applications where patient outcomes are connected to an evidence-based computed model, thereby putting data as a &ldquo;digital first&rdquo; asset in the healthcare system. The computing environment would allow scientific and medical researchers to solve problems with many degrees of freedom in ways that allow data to inform models and simulations to build better models.<br /><br />Achieving this vision of a rich computing ecosystem will require new capabilities in hardware (computing, network, and storage); management modes of operation; and software. Providing true convergence among current and future computing environments presents many technical and organization challenges, but it could provide capabilities in scientific research, national security, healthcare, and industry well beyond what is possible today.<br /><br />View Full Text:<br /><br />September 9, 2019<br /><br />View Full Text:<br /><br />The Future Computing (FC) Community of Interest (CoI) meeting on August 5&ndash;6, 2019, explored the evolving computing landscape to inform agencies about potential opportunities as well as gaps in the Nation&rsquo;s future computing objectives. The meeting focused on where computing will be in the next decade and beyond while also looking at emerging and future applications. It considered the need for new software concepts and approaches to effectively capitalize on new hardware architectures and paradigms. The long period of sustained growth in computing power over the last five decades, characterized by Moore&rsquo;s Law and Dennard Scaling, is expected to end over the next decade. The continued improvement in computing performance will now require moving to new modalities and new means of cooperation and partnership for the benefit of the Nation.<br /><br />The FC-CoI meeting was held at the offices of the Federal Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program in Washington, D.C. The meeting brought together key members of industry, academia, and the Federal Government over a two-day period to discuss the future of computing. The meeting had been advertised in the Federal Register to encourage broad participation from the advanced computing community.

{"url": "https://fas.org/issues/biological-chemical-and-other-non-nuclear-threats/", "title": "Biological, Chemical, & Other Non-Nuclear Threats", "authors": "Fas", "content": "Biological, chemical and other non-nuclear threats, such as cyber\u00a0and drone attacks, constitute a class of weapons that may not cause as much mass physical\u00a0destruction as nuclear weapons can, but can result in significant mass effects on, and/or mass\u00a0disruptions to, a targeted populace. Weapons experts still debate whether these non-nuclear weapons can truly be considered weapons of mass destruction; however, certain types of biological weapons, such as weaponized smallpox or anthrax, could in principle harm millions of people depending on the scenario and the extent of the population\u2019s exposure to the biological weapons. Chemical weapons under almost all circumstances would not result in massive harm to millions of people. Nonetheless, from a cost perspective, chemical weapons and even biological weapons are considerably less expensive than nuclear weapons. Still, chemical and biological weapons could have similar deterrent effects as nuclear weapons. Thus, from the viewpoint of many nation-states, chemical and biological weapons are so-called poor man\u2019s nuclear weapons.<br /><br />The Challenges of Reducing and Detecting These Threats<br /><br />Addressing these threats is difficult because the weapons can be manufactured in ways that use\u00a0civilian technology and materials. Furthermore, manufacturing them does not\u00a0typically require large observable infrastructures to be established, thus making it hard to detect their production. While chemical and biological weapons are banned internationally via the Chemical Weapons Convention and Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention with the vast majority of nations as adherents, the world has witnessed that certain states, for example, Syria still have chemical weapons as well as suspected biological weapons. As of late 2013 through early 2014, the Syrian government has promised to dismantle its chemical weapons program.<br /><br />FAS has had a long history in bringing leading chemical and biological experts to analyze these threats, educate policymakers and the public, and make recommendations to reduce the risks. For instance, FAS in recent years has created the Virtual Biosecurity Center (VBC) to provide a platform for education. FAS has also convened legal, scientific, and political experts in workshops such as a January 2014 workshop on bio-forensics to examine state-level options for response to biological threats or attacks. FAS seeks to further this work in chemical weapons assessments, as well. In particular, FAS has had expert analysis during the early phases of the chemical weapons crisis in Syria.<br /><br />Other Non-Nuclear Threats<br /><br />Weapons technologies other than nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons will most likely increasingly pose challenges for international security. For example, the increasing use of drones for both surveillance and armed attacks by the United States and a growing number of additional countries might lead to global and regional arms races in drone use or might result in asymmetric means of targeted opponents striking back. In addition, cyber-attacks as demonstrated by the use of Stuxnet to destroy and disable about 1,000 uranium enrichment centrifuges in Iran have raised concern about counter-cyber-attacks against the United States and its allies. Also in this threat area, we at FAS will investigate the use of prompt global strike advanced conventional weapons to achieve strategic purposes or to target terrorists and other non-state actors. FAS is expanding its network of experts to assess these and other non-nuclear threats can are present or could emerge in the future.<br /><br />Support FAS<br /><br />Your support\u00a0enables us to\u00a0inform the nuclear debate,\u00a0reduce government secrecy, and\u00a0inject science into public policy. Together, we will strive for a\u00a0safer and more informed world for all.<br /><br />", "publish_time": 1569727054979, "collection_time": 1569727054979, "summary": "Biological, chemical and other non-nuclear threats, such as cyber and drone attacks, constitute a class of weapons that may not cause as much mass physical destruction as nuclear weapons can, but can result in significant effects on, and/or mass disruptions to, a given populace.", "source": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u8054\u76df"}

Today, DARPA continues to lead innovation in AI research as it funds a broad portfolio of R&amp;D programs, ranging from basic research to advanced technology development. DARPA believes this future, where systems are capable of acquiring new knowledge through generative contextual and explanatory models, will be realized upon the development and application of &ldquo;Third Wave&rdquo; AI technologies.<br /><br />DARPA announced in September 2018 a multi-year investment of more than $2 billion in new and existing programs called the &ldquo;AI Next&rdquo; campaign. Key areas of the campaign include automating critical DoD business processes, such as security clearance vetting or accrediting software systems for operational deployment; improving the robustness and reliability of AI systems; enhancing the security and resiliency of machine learning and AI technologies; reducing power, data, and performance inefficiencies; and pioneering the next generation of AI algorithms and applications, such as &ldquo;explainability&rdquo; and common sense reasoning.<br /><br />AI Next builds on DARPA&lsquo;s five decades of AI technology creation to define and to shape the future, always with the Department&rsquo;s hardest problems in mind. Accordingly, DARPA will create powerful capabilities for the DoD by attending specifically to the following areas:<br /><br />New Capabilities: AI technologies are applied routinely to enable DARPA R&amp;D projects, including  more than 60 exisiting programs, such as the , and other programs related to real-time analysis of sophisticated cyber attacks, detection of fraudulent imagery, construction of dynamic kill-chains for all-domain warfare, human language technologies, multi-modality automatic target recognition, biomedical advances, and control of prosthetic limbs. DARPA will advance AI technologies to enable automation of critical Department business processes. One such process is the lengthy accreditation of software systems prior to operational deployment. Automating this accreditation process with known AI and other technologies now appears possible.<br /><br />Robust AI: AI technologies have demonstrated great value to missions as diverse as space-based imagery analysis, cyberattack warning, supply chain logistics and analysis of microbiologic systems. At the same time, the failure modes of AI technologies are poorly understood. DARPA is working to address this shortfall, with focused R&amp;D, both analytic and empirical. DARPA&rsquo;s success is essential for the Department to deploy AI technologies, particularly to the tactical edge, where reliable performance is required.<br /><br />Adversarial AI: The most powerful AI tool today is machine learning (ML). ML systems can be easily duped by changes to inputs that would never fool a human. The data used to train such systems can be corrupted. And, the software itself is vulnerable to cyber attack. These areas, and more, must be addressed at scale as more AI-enabled systems are operationally deployed.<br /><br />High Performance AI: Computer performance increases over the last decade have enabled the success of machine learning, in combination with large data sets, and software libraries. More performance at lower electrical power is essential to allow both data center and tactical deployments. DARPA has demonstrated analog processing of AI algorithms with 1000x speedup and 1000x power efficiency over state-of-the-art digital processors, and is researching AI-specific hardware designs. DARPA is also attacking the current inefficiency of machine learning, by researching methods to drastically reduce requirements for labeled training data.<br /><br />Next Generation AI: The machine learning algorithms that enable face recognition and self-driving vehicles were invented over 20 years ago. DARPA has taken the lead in pioneering research to develop the next generation of AI algorithms, which will transform computers from tools into problem-solving partners. DARPA research aims to enable AI systems to explain their actions, and to acquire and reason with common sense knowledge. DARPA R&amp;D produced the first AI successes, such as expert systems and search, and more recently has advanced machine learning tools and hardware. DARPA is now creating the next wave of AI technologies that will enable the United States to maintain its technological edge in this critical area.<br /><br />In addition to new and existing DARPA research, a key component of the campaign will be DARPA&rsquo;s Artificial Intelligence Exploration (AIE) program, which was first announced in July 2018 and renewed in August 2019. AIE constitutes a series of high-risk, high payoff projects where researchers work to establish the feasibility of new AI concepts within 18 months of award. DARPA uses streamlined contracting procedures and funding mechanisms to move these efforts from proposal to project kick-off within three months of an opportunity announcement. Beginning in August 2019, forthcoming AIE Opportunities will be published on the  under Program Announcement DARPA-PA-19-03; older AIE Opportunities were listed under DARPA-PA-18-02.<br /><br />BackgroundThe advance of technology has evolved the roles of humans and machines in conflict from direct confrontations between humans to engagements mediated by machines. Originally, humans engaged in primitive forms of combat. With the advent of the industrial era, however, humans recognized that machines could greatly enhance their warfighting capabilities. Networks then enabled teleoperation, which eventually proved vulnerable to electronic attack and subject to constraint due to long signal propagation distances and times. The next stage in warfare will involve more capable autonomous systems, but before we can allow such machines to supplement human warfighters, they must achieve far greater levels of intelligence.<br /><br />Traditionally, we have designed machines to handle well-defined, high-volume or high-speed tasks, freeing humans to focus on problems of ever-increasing complexity. In the 1950s and 1960s, early computers were automating tedious or laborious tasks. It was during this era that scientists realized it was possible to simulate human intelligence and the field of artificial intelligence (AI) was born. AI would be the means for enabling computers to solve problems and perform functions that would ordinarily require a human intellect.<br /><br />Early work in AI emphasized handcrafted knowledge, and computer scientists constructed so-called expert systems that captured the specialized knowledge of experts in rules that the system could then apply to situations of interest. Such &ldquo;first wave&rdquo; AI technologies were quite successful &ndash; tax preparation software is a good example of an expert system &ndash; but the need to handcraft rules is costly and time-consuming and therefore limits the applicability of rules-based AI.<br /><br />The past few years have seen an explosion of interest in a sub-field of AI dubbed machine learning that applies statistical and probabilistic methods to large data sets to create generalized representations that can be applied to future samples. Foremost among these approaches are deep learning (artificial) neural networks that can be trained to perform a variety of classification and prediction tasks when adequate historical data is available. Therein lies the rub, however, as the task of collecting, labelling, and vetting data on which to train such &ldquo;second wave&rdquo; AI techniques is prohibitively costly and time-consuming.<br /><br />DARPA envisions a future in which machines are more than just tools that execute human-programmed rules or generalize from human-curated data sets. Rather, the machines DARPA envisions will function more as colleagues than as tools. Towards this end, DARPA research and development in human-machine symbiosis sets a goal to partner with machines. Enabling computing systems in this manner is of critical importance because sensor, information, and communication systems generate data at rates beyond which humans can assimilate, understand, and act. Incorporating these technologies in military systems that collaborate with warfighters will facilitate better decisions in complex, time-critical, battlefield environments; enable a shared understanding of massive, incomplete, and contradictory information; and empower unmanned systems to perform critical missions safely and with high degrees of autonomy. DARPA is focusing its investments on a third wave of AI that brings forth machines that understand and reason in context.<br /><br />Tags|Adaptability<br /><br />|AI|Algorithms|Cyber|Data|Interface|Opportunities<br /><br />|Tech-Foundations<br /><br />|SimilarlyTaggedContent<br /><br />ImagesOpportunities<br /><br />AI Exploration<br /><br />(DARPA-PA-19-03)<br /><br />Open Topics<br /><br />New topics are posted on an ongoing basis.

All contractors sign a secrecy agreement that is consistent with the terms and conditions of their contract. A secrecy agreement doesnt oblige officers and contractors to absolute silence, but it does require them to keep national security secrets for as long as the US Government deems the information to be classified. This is a lifelong obligation. In order to help avoid the damage to national security and to the Agencys mission that disclosing classified information would inflict, the CIA created the Publications Review Board (PRB) to preview materials produced by CIA personnel former and current (both employees and contractors)  to determine if they contain such classified information before they are shared with publishers, blog-subscribers, a TV audience, ghost-writers, co-authors, editors, family members, assistants, representatives, or anyone else not authorized to receive or review such classified information.<br /><br />What Must Be Submitted to the PRB?<br /><br />Current and former CIA officers and contractors who have signed the standard CIA secrecy agreement are required to submit to the PRB any and all materials they intend to share with the public that are intelligence related, such as materials that mention the CIA or intelligence activities, or that concern topics to which they had access to classified information while employed at or performing contractual work for CIA. This submission requirement extends beyond the sub-set of topics they may have had immediate responsibility for on a day-to-day basis.<br /><br />Publishing: Publishing is more than having a printing house bind copies of a book. It means communicating by any means (including orally or electronically), information regardless of form to any person or entity other than the CIAs PRB or a US Government official authorized by the CIA to receive such information for prepublication review. This encompasses materials including but not limited to: book reviews, Op-ed pieces, scholarly papers, scripts, screenplays, blogs, speeches, and other materials. Thus, material covered by a CIA Secrecy Agreement requiring prepublication review must be submitted and approved prior to discussing the material with or showing it to individuals such as a publisher, co-author, agent, editor, ghost-writer, personal representative, family member, or assistant.<br /><br />Relating to CIA or intelligence activities: Not everything former and current CIA officers and contractors write requires prepublication review. For example, the prepublication requirement does not apply to material such as gardening, wine tasting, stamp collecting, sports and so forth, because they are outside of the purview of the CIA mission or intelligence. However, commentary on matters such as intelligence operations or tradecraft (even fictional works), foreign intelligence, foreign events of intelligence interest, ones career, scientific or technological developments discussed in an intelligence context, and other topics that touch upon CIA interests or responsibilities need PRB approval.<br /><br />Why Do Materials Need To Be Reviewed?<br /><br />In addition to protecting national security, the PRB is also protecting CIA officers and contractors from legal liability. For instance, one may unwittingly share insights on events and capabilities that are thought to be public knowledge, but in fact have not been officially released by the CIA or the US Government. Accidental disclosure is still disclosure, and opens a person up to possible civil or criminal penalties. The PRB helps current and former CIA officers and contractors avoid this by identifying problematic material and working with them to find ways to make their points, while avoiding classified information disclosure. For instance, PRB staff often compare declassified material found at the CIAs  and  with materials submitted for review.<br /><br />What Kind of Information Might Be Classified?<br /><br />As outlined in  (sec. 1.4), the following categories of information may be classified if unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable or describable damage to the national security:<br /><br />military plans, weapons systems, or operations;<br /><br />foreign government information;<br /><br />intelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology;<br /><br />foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources;<br /><br />scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the national security;<br /><br />United States Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities;<br /><br />vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services relating to the national security; or<br /><br />the development, production, or use of weapons of mass destruction.<br /><br />In combination with these criteria, authors are encouraged to ask the following questions during the writing process to get an idea of what information the PRB is protecting:<br /><br />As worded, does the text reveal classified information? Why is this information classified [or not]?<br /><br />Would releasing this information damage national security or harm CIAs intelligence sources and methods?<br /><br />Some individual pieces of information may not cause national security damage when standing alone, but can do so if compiled with other information. Also, the PRB is not authorized to release official records or text from Government documents. Individuals seeking such information may submit a FOIA or Privacy Act Request using the procedures found  and , respectively.<br /><br />Resume Prepublication Review<br /><br />One of the challenges of a career in intelligence is composing a resume that doesnt reveal any secrets. Although many details of the Agencys work are classified, a lot of information about  are publicly available. These occupational descriptions are great examples of what current and former Agency officers can share about their work, and provide a good basis on which to prepare resumes and memoirs that will smoothly pass through the prepublication review process. In addition, the guidelines below may be generally helpful for avoiding content that is problematic for prepublication review. Remember  some things CANNOT be used:<br /><br />Countries  Use regional terms instead of specific cities or countries.<br /><br />Agency-specific - Use general training or software descriptions as opposed to the specific names or titles, which may be classified.<br /><br />Names - Do not use names of people and/or places.&#160; Please contact the Publications Review Board before using Agency colleagues as references.<br /><br />Numbers  Use general terms to describe budget information and/or personnel information (e.g., hundreds or millions or several)<br /><br />Office - Do not use organizational names below the office level (e.g., avoid group or branch names).&#160;<br /><br />Technical details - Use general terms instead of the specific details.<br /><br />How To Reach Us?<br /><br />The PRB exists to help protect against unauthorized disclosures, but ultimately, each CIA officer or contractor is responsible for protecting any classified information they possess. Should a CIA officer or contractor publish materials that contain classified information  either because they did not comply with the PRBs changes or because they chose to bypass the PRB process by not submitting their manuscript for PRB pre-publication review  they could be subject to possible civil and criminal penalties. Cooperating with pre-publication review helps keep CIA officers, contractors, and the Agency safe.<br /><br />Former Agency officers and contractors who need to contact the PRB regarding items to be reviewed can do so through the  page.
