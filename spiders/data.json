The Administration’s proposal for refugee admissions in Fiscal Year 2020 will allow the Department of Homeland Security to focus on addressing the ongoing crisis at the southern border, reducing a staggering asylum backlog that unfairly delays relief for those with meritorious claims, and completing more overall cases in an increasingly multifaceted humanitarian workload. The refugee proposal also supports U.S. foreign policy interests, and the Department’s engagement with regional and international partners, by offering nationals of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras the opportunity to seek refugee status close to home rather than embark on a dangerous and often futile journey to the United States in the hands of smugglers and criminal organizations. I look forward to consulting with Congress regarding this proposal, as well as DHS’ ongoing efforts to address the border crisis, uphold the rule of law, and restore integrity to the immigration system.', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/09/26/statement-acting-secretary-mcaleenan-refugee-proposal', 'source': '国土安全部'}

Our geographical proximity, common principles, and democratic values have led to close cooperation between both countries over the years, from addressing historical migration flows to efforts to build a more stable and prosperous region. The broad scope of this relationship has progressed into key agreements with respect to economic and environmental cooperation; cultural, humanitarian, and security support; counternarcotic efforts; and migration.For many countries, the global challenges to achieving sustainable development have grown in recent decades. In the case of Honduras, natural disasters, drug trafficking, transnational criminal organizations, and international economic and financial conditions have all negatively affected the country’s economic growth, social development, human rights, and security. In this context, a holistic approach is needed to address irregular migration throughout the region.Recognizing the mutual interest in overcoming these global challenges, both countries commit to implement the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Republic of Honduras for Cooperation in the Examination of Protection Claims, which is designed to create economic and formal job opportunities for Hondurans with a joint commitment to continue building stronger border security and law enforcement cooperation. \xa0This agreement incorporates the framework of applicable international conventions for individuals seeking protection to execute a more humanitarian approach to addressing out-migration from Honduras. It takes into account the economic capabilities of Honduras for implementation, as well as cooperation with the United States and international organizations. Both countries will periodically review implementation of this agreement and make the necessary adjustments or consider the potential expansion of cooperation to ensure its success.The United States and Honduras reaffirm their commitment to combat mutual threats, including terrorism, transnational criminal organizations and gangs, drug trafficking, and trafficking in persons. Leaders from both countries pledge to promote economic prosperity, regional stability, democratic institutions, and the protection of human rights for the benefit of both nations.', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/09/26/joint-statement-between-us-government-and-government-honduras', 'source': '国土安全部'}

McAleenan announced the combined impact of DHS initiatives that will effectively end \xa0“catch and release” for Central American families arriving at the border. The policy, which will be instituted by DHS starting next week, is part of the Trump Administration’s strategy to mitigate the loopholes that act as a “pull factor” for family units seeking to cross illegally at the Southwest border.“With some humanitarian and medical exceptions, DHS will no longer be releasing family units from Border Patrol Stations into the interior,” said Acting Secretary McAleenan. “This means that for family units, the largest demographic by volume arriving at the border this year, the court-mandated practice of catch and release, due to the inability of DHS to complete immigration proceedings with families detained together in custody, will have been mitigated. This is a vital step in restoring the rule of law and integrity to our immigration system.”If migrant family units do not claim fear of return, they will be quickly returned to their country of origin, in close collaboration with Central American countries. If they do claim fear, they will generally be returned to Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).Implementing these tools ensures effective immigration results without releasing family units into the U.S. interior. This approach also serves as a transition to full implementation of the Flores final rule, which will further allow DHS to hold families together through fair and expeditious immigration proceedings.Apprehensions have hit record levels this year. In May, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection apprehended or encountered over 144,000 migrants at our Southwest border, 90% crossed illegally between ports of entry. This included a day of over 5,800 border crossings in a single 24-hour period. It also included the largest single group ever apprehended, 1,036 migrants crossing together in the El Paso sector. Of the record May apprehensions, 72% were of unaccompanied children and family units.\xa0However, upon the implementation of several DHS initiatives, daily arrivals have decreased by 64% from May and total enforcement actions for Central Americans arriving at the border have been reduced by over 70%.Acting Secretary McAleenan’s prepared remarks from the speech can be found here.\xa0\xa0', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/09/23/acting-secretary-mcaleenan-announces-end-widespread-catch-and-release', 'source': '国土安全部'}

This awareness, coupled with the history of recent tragedies, has galvanized the Department of Homeland Security to expand its counterterrorism mission focus beyond terrorists operating abroad, to include those radicalized to violence within our borders by violent extremists of any ideology.”The Acting Secretary explained that the new strategic framework will make it clear that the Department is committed to addressing the threat posed by terrorism and targeted violence at home, just as it is committed to continuing to aggressively pursue the foreign terrorist organizations it has denied entry to the United States for nearly seventeen years.The strategic framework offers a vision to expands DHS’s counterterrorism mission to face modern threats by implementing proven, whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. It is designed to support the White House’s 2017 National Security Strategy and execute upon the DHS responsibilities enumerated in the Administration’s2018 National Strategy for Counterterrorism.The Strategic Framework outlines the Department’s vision around the following goals:DHS was founded after the attacks of September 11, 2001 with the mission of safeguarding the country from threats, both foreign and domestic. Nearly two decades after the attacks, the United States faces an increasingly complex and evolving threat of terrorism and targeted violence. Since its inception, DHS has developed and implemented an array of tools to address threats to the nation. The implementation of this strategy will utilize those tools to protect the nation and prevent future terrorism and targeted violence.Please follow this link to review the DHS Strategic Framework for Combating Terrorism and Targeted Violence.', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/09/20/acting-secretary-mcaleenan-announces-dhs-strategy-combating-terrorism-and-targeted', 'source': '国土安全部'}

We support safe evacuations of people in impacted areas, maintain public order, and safeguard property when they occur. Weeks in advance of Hurricane Dorian’s landfall, DHS tracked its path and began developing sound response plans, resulting in a whole of government and community approach before, during, and after impact. Our Department continues to work closely together to support those affected by Hurricane Dorian.DHS components, especially the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are working countless hours to support the response and recovery efforts of our state and local government across the region. \xa0\xa0\xa0We also continue to partner with the private sector, and non-governmental organizations, such as the Salvation Army and American Red Cross, to provide aid and support to our citizens and Bahamian survivors.FEMA deployed more than 1,200 personnel to support response efforts to Hurricane Dorian across multiple states, assisting local, state, and tribal governments, as needed. Throughout the Southeast, FEMA staged areas, stocked with food, water, and other commodities. CBP also deployed people and assets to support federal, state and local agency partners, including aerial and urban search and rescue assets, advanced first aid capabilities, and aviation assets with real-time aerial damage assessment and tracking and detection capabilities.

ICT’s annual conference is among the world’s most influential forums for experts in the fields of intelligence, defense, policing, and security studies, attracting more than 1,400 leaders from over 65 nations.In addition to advancing global collaboration and facilitating new partnerships, this year’s conference commemorated decades of international cooperation following the tragic attacks on September 11, 2001. Under Secretary Glawe called upon this shared history on Tuesday in an address to a memorial ceremony for the victims of 9/11 and terrorism worldwide.“Terrorism is terrorism – whether domestic or international – and violent threats to our freedom and the basic tenants to our free society must be eliminated,” stated Under Secretary Glawe. “The necessity to share information between international partners is critical to preventing future terrorist attacks. We must continue to work to raise our intelligence capacities to identify and mitigate terrorist threats.”Under Secretary Glawe’s remarks further underscored how enhanced collaboration, both at home and abroad, can aid in the early identification and mitigation of terrorist activities. Amongst Under Secretary Glawe were the Executive Assistant Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Jay Tabb, Director of the Office of Counter-Terrorism for the United Nations Dr. Jehangir Khan, Ambassador-at-Large and Coordinator for Counterterrorism Nathan Sales from the State Department, and Minister of Public Security Gilad Erdan in Israel. The ICT annual conference serves as an excellent forum to share innovative ideas for policymakers and senior officials to fight against terrorism.I&A has realigned its intelligence resources and enhanced several initiatives which focus on the highest priority threats to the Homeland and integrating intelligence into operational functions. As a result of these efforts, I&A has significantly increased its ability to identify and report on threats from open source information, including a 65% increase in reporting from FY2017 to FY2019.

Through the month of August, the total number of people apprehended or found to be inadmissible was 64,006; this is a 22% decline from 82,055 in July and a 56% decline since the May peak of 144,255.“Under President Trump’s leadership, we’ve been able to utilize a number of tools to help begin to mitigate, but not end, the national security and humanitarian crisis at the southern border,” said Acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan. “The continued drop in enforcement actions is encouraging, but make no mistake, we’re still in a crisis and more must be done. Until Congress makes targeted changes to immigration laws, we will continue to see stark challenges.”Recent domestic policy initiatives and international agreements to address legal and illegal immigration have contributed to the decline, including: agreements with Guatemala to address irregular migration, the Migrant Protection Protocols with Mexico, the final rule regarding non-Mexican asylum seekers at the southern border, interior enforcement operations, and international cooperation between the United States and Central American countries, particularly efforts to disrupt and dismantle alien smuggling organizations.Traditionally enforcement actions in August have been higher than July during six of the past eight years, confirming that this year’s decrease from July to August is not just a traditional seasonal decrease. In Fiscal Year 2018, August apprehensions were 16% higher than July.', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/09/10/border-numbers-fall-third-month-row-remain-high', 'source': '国土安全部'}

Promulgating this rule and seeking termination of the FSA are important steps towards an immigration system that is humane and operates consistently with the intent of Congress.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) are issuing final regulations that implement:“Today, the government has issued a critical rule that will permit the Department of Homeland Security to appropriately hold families together and improve the integrity of the immigration system,” said Acting Secretary McAleenan. “This rule allows the federal government to enforce immigration laws as passed by Congress and ensures that all children in U.S. government custody are treated with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability.”“The Department of Health and Human Services, through our Office of Refugee Resettlement, provides quality and compassionate care for unaccompanied alien children who are referred to our custody,” said Secretary Azar. “In this rule, we are implementing the relevant and substantive portions of the Flores Settlement Agreement pertaining to standards for the temporary care, placement, and release of those minors.

{'title': 'United States and Canada Implement Preclearance Agreement  ', 'publish_time': '2019-08-15 14:14:18', 'content': 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced today, in partnership with the Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada, the implementation of an agreement to improve mutual security and expedite lawful travel through preclearance for travelers and their accompanying baggage on certain transports. The collaboration is articulated in the Agreement on Land, Rail, Marine, and Air (LRMA) Transport Preclearance between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada, which supersedes the previous 2001 U.S.-Canada Agreement on Air Transport Preclearance, and expands upon the two countries’ partnership.\xa0Preclearance is the process by which officers stationed abroad inspect and make admissibility decisions about travelers and their accompanying baggage before they leave a foreign port, simultaneously increasing efficiency and security. The LRMA provides the legal framework and reciprocal authorities necessary for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Canada Border Services Agency to carry out security, facilitation, and inspection processes in the other country.\xa0“Preclearance strengthens economic competitiveness and mutual security, and benefits travelers by expediting their clearance into the U.S. before they ever leave Canada,” said Acting Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan. “This agreement provides the opportunity for CBP to build on six decades of successful operations and, for the first time, to conduct full preclearance in the rail, ferry, and cruise ship environments. This achievement is important for the Department’s security objectives and is another example of just how close the U.S. – Canada relationship stands.”CBP currently conducts preclearance operations at eight Canadian airports: Calgary, Edmonton, Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, and Winnipeg. CBP officers also conduct immigration pre-inspection at multiple locations in British Columbia in the rail and marine modes; these locations will have the opportunity to convert to full preclearance, per the terms of the Agreement.“The new Canada–U.S. Preclearance Agreement is now in force, creating new opportunities in all modes of transportation in both Canada and the United States,” said the Honourable Ralph Goodale, Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. “Expanding preclearance makes travel faster and bolsters trade, while better protecting our rights.”As the Agreement is fully reciprocal, in addition to the potential expansion of CBP preclearance operations in Canada, the Agreement permits Canada to pursue preclearance operations in the United States. This agreement also enables exploration of co-location at small and remote ports of entry and includes additional tools and authorities to help enforce immigration, customs, and agriculture laws, facilitate lawful travel, and ensure officer protection and accountability.The LRMA was signed by the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security and Canadian Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness on March 16, 2015, fulfilling a commitment of the Beyond the Border Action Plan (Beyond the Border Action Plan). The U.S. Congress passed the necessary supporting legislation in December 2016 and Canada’s Parliament did so in December 2017. Canada published their required implementing regulations in June 2019, paving the way for entry into force following an exchange of Diplomatic Notes today.\xa0', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/08/15/united-states-and-canada-implement-preclearance-agreement', 'source': '国土安全部'}

Well, thank you all and welcome. Thank you all for braving the Arizona summer heat to be out here with us today. We have a little bit of shade here.I want to say that I'm honored to introduce the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, Kevin McAleenan. Secretary McAleenan was designated as the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security by President Trump on April 8th, 2019. Prior to his appointment, he served as Commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection after U.S. Senate confirmation in March of 2018 and after having served as the Acting Commissioner since January of 2017. Mr. Secretary, welcome to Yuma and San Luis, Arizona. Thank you for your continued support to CBP, the mission and the challenges we face here in Arizona.Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin K. McAleenan:Thanks, Chief. As we begin, I want to start with a few words on the recent shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio. First, my heart and the Department's thoughts are with the grieving families from both incidents, but I want to talk for a moment about El Paso. The Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection are deeply embedded in the community of El Paso, a city with a unique and integrated culture, where two nations in two major cities meet. With over 4,000 DHS professionals and their families living there, protecting our border, facilitating the flow of lawful trade and travel that is a lifeblood of the region. This horrific act was an attack on our family and our community as well. A number of DHS families were directly affected as close family members were victims of the attack. CBP Port Director Donna Sifford was actually in the Walmart during the attack.She survived uninjured and rendered lifesaving aide to another victim who turned out to be one of her neighbors. The fact that the absolute hate, hateful coward, as Donna called him, was motivated by a poisonous and destructive white supremacist extremist ideology that is underpinning multiple incidents globally over the past years, is an even deeper offense.He said he sought to kill Hispanics. The majority of our El Paso team working to protect our nation, uphold the rule of law, and care for vulnerable migrants is Hispanic. These professionals are American patriots who work every day to protect what our nation of immigrants is really about. They protect all of us with heart and humanity. They're resilient, they're strong, and they will persevere. But this attack and this ideology offends all of us and we must address it with moral clarity. It is hate, it is domestic terrorism, and it must be fought together by Americans of all races, ethnicities, and faiths. And at the Department of Homeland Security, we have redoubled our efforts and recommitted all components of our department to do just that.We are here today to provide an update on the ongoing security and humanitarian crisis here at our border. The situation is improving by every available metric, but, and I want to be very clear about this, we remain at and beyond crisis levels in illegal crossings, even as our initiatives to address irregular flows and mitigate humanitarian conditions are making an impact.I'm pleased to be here today alongside two outstanding leaders. Chief Patrol Agent Porvaznik and Port Director Schwamm to announce U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s enforcement actions for the month of July, 2019. Just two months ago in May, CBP apprehended or encountered 144,266 migrants. That peak that you see that my left crossing our border illegally or arriving at ports of entry without documents. The highest monthly total in 13 years. In July, that number was 82,049 - a 43% decrease from May and a 20% decrease from our June numbers.I want to emphasize that nearly 90% of those total enforcement actions were apprehensions from illegal entries crossing between ports. In July, CBP realized a 26% decline in total enforcement actions for individuals from the Northern Triangle of Central America, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. The most significant decline is noted in aliens from Guatemala, with a 41% decrease from June levels. In addition, individuals from Honduras declined 16% in June, El Salvador, 21% in June, and Mexico, 11%. In the same timeframe, from May to July, both unaccompanied children and family unit apprehension decreased by more than 50%, demonstrating the success of several recent initiatives by the Administration as well as its international partners to address this border security and migration crisis. This drop is not attributable to seasonal trends. Over the past five years, immigration flows have responded to pull factors, such as the perceived ability to stay in the U.S. due to weaknesses in U.S immigration law, not to historical, seasonal patterns driven by agricultural work. Over the last five years, the May to July decrease in crossings averaged 9% and went up or stayed relatively flat in some years. 43% is a dramatic downturn and is directly attributable to our international partnership efforts.Thanks to the President's engagement with Mexico and Guatemala, along with several other Central American countries, we've begun to take shared responsibility with partners for the irregular migration flows that have become a regional crisis. We continue to see Mexico making a significant effort on their southern border between Chiapas and Guatemala, as well as on the transportation routes of human smugglers, and we need them to continue to sustain this. In addition, their efforts have helped reduce the phenomenon of large groups crossing our border, which was an acute challenge here in the Yuma sector. Our partnerships with the countries of the Northern Triangle, especially Guatemala, had been increasingly effective at stemming irregular migratory flows. We're making progress, but we need to continue to build on that success. These are regional issues that involve the sending, transit, and destination countries working together, and any of our solutions must involve those partners.By aligning our migration policies and providing access to protection to those who need it, as close to home as possible, in concert with international nongovernmental organizations, this regional approach substantially limits the ability of coyotes or alien smuggling organizations to profit off the false promises and to exploit those individuals seeking to come to our border. This process limits the power and profits of criminals and creates a path to investment and further collaboration in the region. These reductions in flows combined with a $4.5 billion in emergency supplemental funding we requested on May 1st and received from Congress six weeks ago have allowed us to dramatically mitigate the challenging overflow conditions in our facilities.Most critically, due to the ability of the Department of Health and Human Services to procure additional bed space for unaccompanied children, we've been able to eliminate long waits at border stations and reduce the number of children in custody at the border. From a peak crisis level of almost 2,700 unaccompanied children in border stations, with over 1,200 of them in custody for 72 hours or more, yesterday afternoon's report reflected 160 children in our custody at the border, with an average time in custody of under 24 hours. That means that due to the efforts to apply the increased funding that we saw for, that we asked for, and fought for, we are now able to process, medically screen, place, and transfer the 170 children arriving at our border each day in 22 hours on average. For families, we have reduced the total in custody from over 10,000 to approximately 2,000, at only 34 hours average time spent at the border. And for single adults, we reduced from over 8,000 to approximately 2,000, with average times in custody down by 75%.We've also been able to provide better conditions for those in custody, applying the supplemental funding, including using temporary facilities with an increased capacity of 5,000 temporary beds since June 28th. Additional shower and laundry facilities, contracts to increase the number of variety of hot meals, and expanded medical screening and care.While our efforts are working, the volume of migrants crossing our southern border remains at crisis levels. To address this crisis, we must continue to collaborate with our international partners and to seek the targeted fixes to our immigration laws that we've been asking for from Congress.In closing, I want to thank the hardworking men and women of the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection who selflessly serve our country to protect our freedoms and way of life. Your work day in and day out, promotes the security of our communities and your lifesaving efforts to protect vulnerable people every day are absolutely incredible. We've asked a great deal of you this year, and you've stepped out. I want to thank you for that. I look forward to taking some of your questions.[QUESTION INAUDIBLE]So the question is “what is the plan for construction of wall on the border and what does that derive from?” So, CBP has developed a border security improvement plan that defines those priority areas of our border where we need additional border barrier and infrastructure. Yuma sector right here, and this is a new barrier behind me, a 30-foot new border wall that's helping provide security in the sector right adjacent to the Saint Luis II port of entry. These locations have been prioritized by our agents on the ground based on vulnerabilities in the border and the traffic that we're seeing in multiple sectors. We are applying the appropriated funding from Congress. We built the FY 17 funded wall, that's 40 miles. We're building now the 18 and 19 funded wall, and it’s going up in key priority areas that we do have available on our website and can provide in depth information. But I want to emphasize, this is based on where our border patrol agents on the ground said they needed additional capability to improve the security of our sectors along the border. Thank you.[QUESTION INAUDIBLE]Thank you. So first of all, we hold ourselves to the highest possible standard and any allegation of abuse or concern in our facilities is investigated. We have five levels of oversight for conditions in our stations, both internally within CBP and then in our independent Office of Professional Responsibility, the Department of Homeland Security IG, with our Office of Civil Rights and Liberties. And of course, with Congressional oversight and the [Government Accountability Office]. All of them have unfettered access to our facilities and have routine inspections. We're also overseen by court-ordered monitors, uh, from various core settlements over the decades. So it's a lot of access and a lot of oversight of our facilities. Any allegation that's raised, by policy must be immediately reported to an independent investigative agency and they're going to take that for action. Any allegations here in Yuma sector are going undergoing that process. I can't provide you specific investigation today, but I can assure you that it's being followed up by either our Office of Professional Responsibility or the Inspector General at DHS.[QUESTION INAUDIBLE]So that's that five layers of monitoring and oversight that we have every day. We have very clear policies on our responsibilities on how to care for people in our custody. Those are overseen day to day by supervisors trained in these policies. We briefed earlier a group of reporters on the systems that we operate to capture every encounter with a migrant who's in our custody when they're fed, when they have access to a shower, when they have their medicine administered to make sure that we're doing that very carefully, that we're capturing it and we're overseeing that effort. And again, we the multiple layers of oversight and access to ensure that we're following our own policies and that's done in a very rigorous basis all over the border. We had a really challenging situation here in April and May and early June. We were overcrowded at multiple facilities along the border, including Yuma sector. That was very difficult to manage. At this stage with the additional funding and a reduction in flows, we are able to really provide a much better situation in terms of caring custody for those here at the border.[QUESTION INAUDIBLE]So again, I'm not briefing on any specific cases. I'll tell you our policy nationally, if we have an identified agent or officer that was allegedly involved in an issue with someone in our custody, they are appropriately addressed and either taken off law enforcement duties, interacting with migrants, if we have a concern, or handled appropriately. That happens in every single case that is overseen, again, by independent investigative entities.[QUESTION INAUDIBLE]So ICE is doing interior enforcement operations on a routine basis, nationally. Any approach to address this migratory crisis, for instance, has to have balance between what happens in our partnerships in the region, our efforts here at the border, and what we do in terms of the interior. Work site enforcement is part of that. We can't have U.S. employers exploiting migrates, having them work in conditions that are unacceptable, and that are non-competitive with American workers. That's part of ICE’s responsibility. Enforcing the laws on the books every day.[QUESTION INAUDIBLE]So we are planning on expanding the Migrant Protection Protocols border-wide to key ports of entry. San Luis II and San Luis Rio Colorado is one location that we're looking at. Right now, we're partnering with the Government of Mexico to prepare for that eventuality. They've already increased their resources in their inmigración department here working at the border. And we're providing support to the Mexican government and through international organization so that they can be ready to provide appropriate shelter capacity.[QUESTION INAUDIBLE]I don't have a specific date on when MPP would open in this, in this area.[QUESTION INAUDIBLE]Yeah, I think I just did. We do intend to expand the Migrant Protection Protocols. And again, this is a process where people that might be seeking immigration benefits or asylum in the U.S. can access that court decision more quickly. Right now, if a family is released into the U.S., they can wait five years or more for that initial court hearing and they're not getting a decision on their asylum claim. Under the Migrant Protection Protocols, we're trying to establish that initial hearing within a few months of arrival and we're actually getting results. We had an asylum claim granted yesterday of somebody in the Migrant Protection Protocols who had gone through that process and in an expeditious manner in less than seven months since we started the program as opposed to the many years it takes when somebody is released into the U.S. to wait on the non-detained docket with the immigration courts overseen by the Department of Justice.[QUESTION INAUDIBLE]Sure. That's an important question. So the asylum process again is very lengthy, but taking a look at people who are completing their asylum claims from the 2014 arrival cohort of families. In 2017, what we're seeing is about a 10 to 15% ultimate grant rate of asylum by an immigration judge. So it's a very low pass rate, if you will, at the end of the process. And that's because asylum under international law is to protect people from political persecution to protect them from persecution based on race or religion or membership in a social group. It's not a pathway to an economic migration or to choose what country you want to live in. So when we actually finish the process with the immigration courts, which are overwhelmed, they have a 900,000 case backlog, there is a reduced number of people actually granted asylum and that's part of the problem is driving this crisis.[QUESTION INAUDIBLE]So yes, this recent raid was a criminal investigation of multiple businesses in Mississippi. ICE has strict policies that they go through for everyone that they've apprehended to determine if there is a childcare issue. Many are processed and released so that they can be returned to the site where they were apprehended to be linked up with a dependent who needs that care. Many of the folks being apprehended will be released pending an immigration proceeding, especially if they have a child care concern.[QUESTION INAUDIBLE]As ICE briefed yesterday, this was a year-long criminal investigation that they pursued based on a variety of sources.[QUESTION INAUDIBLE]One of the biggest challenges of this crisis is the belief in migrant families in Central America that they'll be released into the United States if they bring a child with them. And so what that drove and what we were very concerned about is the increasing posture of adults bringing children who are not their own to try to take advantage of the weaknesses in our immigration laws. We have over 5,000 instances where we've identified an adult who's not a parent or guardian, but purporting to be a family crossing the border.In response, in April and May, we deployed Homeland Security Investigations personnel to the border. They have over 400 special agents working alongside our Border Patrol agents here at the border to try to determine those family relationships. And they're employing a variety of tactics, in-depth forensic interviews, as well as you noted, DNA testing. And what we're finding out is when a Border Patrol agent refers an adult and a child who they think may not or doesn't have the right relationship, and it could be a trafficking issue, human smuggling issue, in really egregious cases, the child has been used multiple times by different adults to try to cross the border and be released. They're being referred to HSI. HSI does that in-depth interview and they're determining about 15% of those cases are actually fraudulent presentation or fraudulent families. So what we're doing now is expanding the pilot. We've added DNA pilot here in Yuma, it started out in El Paso and then expanded to RGV. Now it's in Yuma. I want to get that worldwide so that we're protecting the children who are being exploited by this crisis.[QUESTION INAUDIBLE]Two different issues. So what I just talked about is actual presentation of fraud, pretending to be a parent or guardian to gain access to the United States to use the weaknesses of the immigration law. There are situations where people cross with family members under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. We have to treat them as unaccompanied. If they're crossing with someone who's not a parent or legal guardian, that's a different issue.", 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/08/09/transcript-press-conference-yuma-az-august-8-2019', 'source': '国土安全部'}

{'title': 'DHS Acting Secretary McAleenan Announces July Migration Statistics Showing Consistent Decline from Record Levels in May', 'publish_time': '2019-08-08 13:31:33', 'content': 'WASHINGTON - Today, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin K. McAleenan announced U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) enforcement actions for the month of July, indicating more than a 20 percent decrease in U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) apprehensions at the Southwest border for the second month in a row.“The situation is improving by every available metric, but, I want to be very clear that we remain at and beyond crisis levels in illegal crossings, even as our initiatives to address irregular flows and mitigate humanitarian conditions are making an impact,” said Acting Secretary McAleenan. “Just two months ago, CBP apprehended or encountered 144,000 individuals crossing our border illegally or presenting without documents at Southwest border ports of entry—the highest monthly total in 13 years. In July, that number was 82,000, a 43% decrease from May and a 21% decrease from the June numbers.These reductions in flows, combined with the $4.5 billion dollars in emergency supplemental funding we requested on May 1st and received from Congress six weeks ago, have allowed us to dramatically mitigate the challenging overflow conditions in our border facilities. We have been able to eliminate long waits in border stations and reduce the number of children in custody at the border.Our partnerships with the countries of the Northern Triangle, especially Guatemala, have been increasingly effective at stemming irregular migratory flows. We continue to see Mexico making a significant effort on their border between Chiapas and Guatemala, as well as on the transportation routes of human smugglers—and we need them to continue to sustain this. While our efforts are working, the volume of migrants crossing our southern border remain at crisis levels. To address this crisis, we will continue to collaborate with our international partners and seek the targeted fixes to our immigration laws from Congress.”According to CBP data, total July enforcement actions for individuals crossing the border from Northern Triangle countries decreased by 26 percent from June. The most significant decline was seen in migrants coming from Guatemala – a 41 percent decrease. Individuals coming from El Salvador decreased by 21 percent and individuals coming from Honduras decreased by 16 percent from June levels. Individuals coming from Mexico also decreased by 11 percent from June. Both unaccompanied alien children and family unit apprehensions decreased by more than 50 percent from May to July.The reductions are due in large part to the recently signed agreement in June with the Government of Mexico to stem the flow of illegal immigration and the international collaboration with the Northern Triangle countries to dismantle and disrupt alien smuggling organizations. While much progress has been made, DHS is still facing an ongoing humanitarian and security crisis at the Southwest border.', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/08/08/dhs-acting-secretary-mcaleenan-announces-july-migration-statistics-showing', 'source': '国土安全部'}

{'title': 'Department of Homeland Security Rescinds Public Notice Regarding Security Conditions at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila', 'publish_time': '2019-08-08 05:48:19', 'content': 'WASHINGTON–Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin K. McAleenan ordered today, effective immediately, rescission of the Public Notice regarding security conditions at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines (MNL) issued in December. The Notice was published on December 27, 2018, after multiple assessments of MNL identified a failure to adequately implement and maintain international security standards and recommended practices established by the International Civil Aviation Organization in Annex 17 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation of 1944.\xa0After months of direct engagement with the United States, the Government of the Philippines has made significant improvements to the security operations of MNL. Both the Manila International Airport Authority and the Government of the Philippines civil aviation security authorities have demonstrated they are willing to work toward sustaining those improvements.The Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), is required under 49 U.S.C. § 44907 to assess the effectiveness of security at all: (1) Foreign airports served by U.S. air carriers; (2) Foreign airports from which a foreign air carrier serves the United States; (3) Foreign airports that pose a high risk of introducing danger to international travel; and (4) Other airports deemed appropriate by the Secretary. If the Secretary of Homeland Security finds, based on TSA’s assessment that an airport has failed to implement effective security measures, the Secretary shall notify the foreign government authorities of that finding and recommend steps to achieve compliance. If an airport fails to remedy identified security deficiencies within 90 days of such notice, the Secretary shall publish a notice in the Federal Register that the airport is non-compliant, post the airport’s identity prominently at major U.S. airports, and notify the news media.Several attacks targeting civil aviation over the past several years, along with ISIL’s and Al-Qaida’s repeated intentions and demonstrated capability clearly indicate the threat that terrorism poses to civil aviation. This is one reason why the United States actively supports the Philippine’s efforts to improve airport security. The U.S. State Department has provided $5 million to help fund airport security improvements at MNL to include training and technology. The TSA has also provided Aviation Security Advisors to the Philippine government to assist with development and implementation of corrective measures at MNL; analysis of security operations; and recommendations on technology use and maintenance; streamline screening operations; and modernizing MNL’s security infrastructure. \xa0DHS and TSA remain committed to working with the Government of the Philippines to help ensure a strong security posture at MNL and enhance global aviation security.', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/08/08/department-homeland-security-rescinds-public-notice-regarding-security-conditions', 'source': '国土安全部'}

McAleenan, announced that an extension of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation for Syria was warranted, pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act. With his signature, he has extended Syria’s TPS designation for 18 months.The decision to extend TPS for Syria was made after a review of the conditions upon which the country’s designation is based, which was ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions, as well as an assessment of whether those conditions continue to exist as required by statute. Following careful consideration of available information, including recommendations received as part of an inter-agency consultation process, the Acting Secretary determined that the conditions supporting Syria’s designation for TPS continue to exist. Thus, under the applicable statute, the current TPS designation must be extended.There are approximately 7,000 Syrian TPS beneficiaries. This 18 month extension of Syria’s designation for TPS permits current Syrian TPS beneficiaries to re-register for TPS and remain in the U.S. with work authorization through March 31, 2021. To be eligible for TPS under Syria’s current designation, along with meeting the other eligibility requirements, individuals must have continuously resided in the U.S. since August 1, 2016, and have been continuously physically present in the U.S. since October 1, 2016. Anyone who has been here since the time of the previous designation may be eligible to seek other forms of immigration relief.Current beneficiaries under Syria’s TPS designation are eligible to re-register for an extension of their status for 18 months, through March 31, 2021. The law requires the Secretary to periodically review the conditions in the foreign state for which a designation is in effect. Over the next 18 months, the Acting Secretary will review conditions in Syria to determine whether its designation should be extended again or terminated. The Secretary will make the next decision to extend or terminate the designation for Syria on or before January 30, 2021. If the Secretary does not determine that the statutory conditions for the designation are no longer met on or by January 30, 2021, an automatic extension of the designation is triggered.Further details about this extension for TPS, including information about the re-registration process and employment authorization documents, will appear in a Federal Register notice.\xa0###', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/08/01/acting-dhs-secretary-mcaleenan-announces-extension-temporary-protected-status-syria', 'source': '国土安全部'}

Use of expedited removal pursuant to the new designation will help alleviate some of the burden and capacity issues currently faced by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) by allowing DHS to more quickly remove certain aliens encountered in the interior.“The new designation adds one more tool for DHS—utilizing specific authority from Congress—to confront the ongoing security and humanitarian crisis on the Southwest border and throughout the country,” said Acting Secretary McAleenan. “We are past the breaking point and must take all appropriate action to enforce the law, along the U.S. borders and within the country’s interior. This designation makes it clear that if you have no legal right to be here, we will remove you.”The Immigration and Nationality Act gives the Acting Secretary “sole and unreviewable discretion” to designate certain aliens as subject to expedited removal pursuant to a 1996 law. This authority has been used many times, including in a 2002 notice that applied the full scope of expedited removal to certain aliens encountered anywhere in the United States for up to two years after arrival by sea. The new designation harmonizes expedited removal for aliens arriving by land with the longstanding process for aliens arriving by sea, and applies to certain aliens\xa0encountered between 14 days and two years of entry within 100 miles of the border, or within two years of entry anywhere in the United States. The new designation is separate from, but complements, a 2004 designation that applies to aliens encountered within 14 days of entry and within 100 miles of the border.Consistent with the Acting Secretary’s express authority to apply expedited removal to certain aliens under existing law, the new designation will take effect upon publication in the Federal Register today and can be found here.Consistent with current law and practice, unaccompanied alien children are not subject to expedited removal under the new or any previous designation. Additionally, any alien who indicates an intention to apply for asylum or expresses a fear of persecution, of torture, or of returning to his or her country, will be referred for an interview with an asylum officer. \xa0While DHS initiatives are making an impact and border enforcement actions have decreased, the situation at the Southwest border remains untenable. In order to solve this crisis and create lasting change at the border, Congress must address the vulnerabilities in our legal framework. In the meantime, the Department must utilize the tools expressly provided by Congress to continue confronting the crisis.', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/07/23/acting-secretary-mcaleenan-announces-new-designation-aliens-subject-expedited', 'source': '国土安全部'}
{'title': 'Joint Statement between the U.S. Government and the Government of Guatemala', 'publish_time': '2019-07-22 09:11:47', 'content': 'The U.S. Government and the Government of Guatemala continue to make important progress on a comprehensive regional approach to addressing irregular migration patterns. The two countries are currently cooperating on several initiatives to reduce the flow of irregular migration and ensure the safety and protection of vulnerable populations, especially children.Both countries have entered into several agreements, the terms of which foster collaboration to expand the capacity of migrant reception, adjudication of protection claims, shelter, and removal infrastructure. By working cooperatively and with international organizations, both governments will continue to harmonize immigration regulations, synchronize regional immigration systems to ensure migrants and children are not victimized by smugglers, and enhance protection systems and capacity through partnership. The partnership also increases Guatemala’s attractiveness to its own citizens and foreign investors through workforce and infrastructure development.Additionally, the governments are working towards signing an agreement to provide support for further protections to Guatemalan H-2A workers by developing a registered Foreign Labor Recruiter program to promote transparency and accountability for those who may operate as such in Guatemala. The H-2A Worker Visa Program provides visas for temporary or seasonal agricultural employment. By regulating Foreign Labor Recruiters in Guatemala, the U.S. Government and the Government of Guatemala are increasing protections for those seeking legal employment opportunities in the U.S., achieving a priority objective for Guatemala and mitigating a major factor of irregular migration into the U.S. With this agreement, the U.S. Government would prioritize H-2A visa appointments ahead of other non-immigrant visa categories for Guatemalans and work to develop and coordinate an outreach campaign to promote the H-2A program in partnership with Guatemala’s Ministry of Labor, focusing on the recruitment of qualified workers.Enhancing protection capacity and expanding access to regular migration avenues in Guatemala will help stem the flow of irregular migration. This goal is being achieved through these agreements and several other initiatives that the U.S. Government and the Government of Guatemala are currently seeking to accomplish together. The U.S. and Guatemala share a common cause in confronting the ongoing border security and humanitarian crisis so that both governments can promote security and prosperity throughout the region. The U.S. Government looks forward to continued partnership with Guatemala to mitigate migratory push factors, bolster capacities, and facilitate regional cooperation. By strengthening the relationship between the two countries through such agreements, the U.S. and Guatemala, as partners, will better protect the most vulnerable populations of Guatemala while confronting irregular migration.', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/07/22/joint-statement-between-us-government-and-government-guatemala', 'source': '国土安全部'}

{'title': 'DHS and DOJ Issue Third-Country Asylum Rule', 'publish_time': '2019-07-15 09:10:58', 'content': 'WASHINGTON – On July 16th, a joint Interim Final Rule (IFR) issued by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security will publish in the Federal Register.This IFR uses the authority delegated by Congress in section 208(b)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to enhance the integrity of the asylum process by placing further restrictions or limitations on eligibility for aliens who seek asylum in the United States. Specifically, the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security are revising 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(c) and 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(c) to add a new bar to eligibility for asylum for an alien who enters or attempts to enter the United States across the southern border, but who did not apply for protection from persecution or torture where it was available in at least one third country outside the alien’s country of citizenship, nationality, or last lawful habitual residence through which he or she transited en route to the United States.Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan issued the following statement:"While the recent supplemental funding was absolutely vital to helping confront the crisis, the truth is that it will not be enough without targeted changes to the legal framework of our immigration system. Until Congress can act, this interim rule will help reduce a major \'pull\' factor driving irregular migration to the United States and enable DHS and DOJ to more quickly and efficiently process cases originating from the southern border, leading to fewer individuals transiting through Mexico on a dangerous journey. Ultimately, today\'s action will reduce the overwhelming burdens on our domestic system caused by asylum-seekers failing to seek urgent protection in the first available country, economic migrants lacking a legitimate fear of persecution, and the transnational criminal organizations, traffickers, and smugglers exploiting our system for profits.”The bar is subject to three limited exceptions, including:(1) an alien who demonstrates that he or she applied for protection from persecution or torture in at least one of the countries through which the alien transited en route to the United States, and the alien received a final judgment denying the alien protection in such country;(2) an alien who demonstrates that he or she satisfies the definition of “victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons” provided in 8 C.F.R. § 214.11; or,(3) an alien who has transited en route to the United States through only a country or countries that were not parties to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 Protocol, or the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.Asylum is a discretionary benefit offered by the United States Government to those fleeing persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.Attorney General William P. Barr issued the following statement:“This Rule is a lawful exercise of authority provided by Congress to restrict eligibility for asylum. The United States is a generous country but is being completely overwhelmed by the burdens associated with apprehending and processing hundreds of thousands of aliens along the southern border. This Rule will decrease forum shopping by economic migrants and those who seek to exploit our asylum system to obtain entry to the United States—while ensuring that no one is removed from the United States who is more likely than not to be tortured or persecuted on account of a protected ground.”The United States has experienced a dramatic increase in the number of aliens encountered along or near the southern land border with Mexico. This increase corresponds with a sharp increase in the number, and percentage, of aliens claiming fear of persecution or torture when apprehended or encountered by DHS. The number of cases referred to DOJ for proceedings before an immigration judge has also risen exponentially, more than tripling between 2013 and 2018. These numbers are projected to continue to increase throughout the remainder of Fiscal Year 2019 and beyond.Only a small minority of these individuals, however, are ultimately granted asylum. The large number of meritless asylum claims places an extraordinary strain on the nation’s immigration system, undermines many of the humanitarian purposes of asylum, has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis of human smuggling, and adversely impacts the United States’ ongoing diplomatic negotiations with foreign countries. This rule mitigates the strain on the country’s immigration system by more efficiently identifying aliens who are misusing the asylum system to enter and remain in the United States rather than legitimately seeking urgent protection from persecution or torture.The IFR is immediately effective upon publication and can be found here.', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/07/15/dhs-and-doj-issue-third-country-asylum-rule', 'source': '国土安全部'}

{'title': 'DHS Announces Decrease in Border Enforcement Actions and Continued Efforts to Address the Ongoing Border Crisis', 'publish_time': '2019-07-09 17:17:32', 'content': "Acting Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan issued the following statement on July 9:Department of Homeland Security (DHS) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data for June indicates a 28 percent drop in enforcement actions along the Southwest Border since May, from 144,278 to 104,344. This year’s decline in apprehensions from May to June outpaces last year’s decline by 11 percent. The reduction in apprehensions accounts for decreases across all demographics, including unaccompanied minors, family units and single adults, as well as decreases in migrants from all Northern Triangle countries, particularly those coming from Guatemala. Decreasing apprehension numbers will provide greater opportunities for the DHS to address capacity challenges for those in custody and speed the movement of unaccompanied children into Health and Human Services (HHS) care.DHS has been taking a “whole of government” approach to confront the ongoing crisis and fulfill our humanitarian and security obligations, including surging personnel from across the Department to high capacity locations on the Southwest border, requesting and receiving continued support from the Department of Defense, expanding medical services, establishing additional soft-sided facilities, surging rescue response operations, and requesting and receiving emergency supplemental funding from Congress.We are also continuing our collaboration with our international partners, formalizing a number of initiatives with Northern Triangle countries to improve the lives and security of our respective citizens by combating human trafficking and the smuggling of illegal goods, helping to limit ‘push’ factors that encourage dangerous irregular migration to the U.S. Additionally, we are working with the Government of Mexico to expand Migrant Protection Protocols to allow the U.S. to more effectively assist legitimate asylum-seekers and individuals fleeing persecution and deter migrants with false or meritless claims from making the journey. And since the administration reached a new agreement with Mexico, we've seen a substantial increase in the number of interdictions on the Mexican southern border.These\xa0initiatives are making an impact. However, we are still in an ongoing border security and humanitarian crisis.

Agüero, Foreign Secretary of Honduras, as well as other senior foreign officials.“This is a call to all Guatemalans: please – you must know that there is no guarantee that you will you get into the United States, regardless of if you bring a child or not,” Sandra Jovel, Guatemalan Minister of Foreign Affairs said in a video posted on Twitter following the tour. “The processes to enter the U.S. are very long, and you will risk your and your children’s lives.”The briefing included an overview of how transnational criminal and human smuggling organizations pair adult aliens with children they are not related to with the intent of posing as family units to help secure release into the U.S. They learned that, in most cases, the adults use fraudulent documents to support their claim. The briefing also focused on the introduction of the Rapid DNA technology pilot which, in addition to careful document inspection, has assisted DHS in identifying many of the fraudulent family schemes.The majority of irregular migrants crossing the U.S. border are traveling from the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Of all Southwest border apprehensions in May, 78 percent came from the Northern Triangle.

{'title': 'Texas Governor Deploys 1,000 National Guard Soldiers to Assist with Border Crisis', 'publish_time': '2019-06-21 17:40:05', 'content': 'WASHINGTON – Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced today that the Lone Star State will be sending approximately 1,000 soldiers from the Texas National Guard to the Southwest border in order to support U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in response to the continued border security and humanitarian crisis. These troops will provide supplemental staffing support at temporary holding facilities, as well as supplemental enforcement capacity at ports of entry along the border.“The crisis at our southern border is unlike anything we’ve witnessed before and has put an enormous strain on the existing resources we have in place," said Governor Abbott. "With the deployment of these troops, we are taking action to confront the crisis at the border and keep potentially dangerous criminals and illegal activity out of our communities. By working together with our federal partners, we will continue to pursue a strong and comprehensive strategy to secure our border."“At DHS, we have a long history of working closely with our partners in Texas, united by the common purpose of keeping the United States and its people safe and secure,” said Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan. “While we are doing everything we can to manage the crisis, the volume of vulnerable populations arriving every day is simply unsustainable. The deployment of Texas National Guard personnel provides critical support to our law enforcement agents at the border at a time of tremendous need.”The combined state and federal effort will help address the humanitarian crisis on our border as well as increase border security for Texas communities. National Guard personnel have provided support—such as counternarcotic support operations— in Texas for decades. Over 4,000 National Guard Troops from Texas, Arizona and New Mexico have helped in securing the border in recent deployments.In the past three weeks alone, more than 45,000 people have been apprehended in Texas crossing the border illegally. Currently, 40 to 60 percent of Border Patrol agents are being pulled away from their border security mission to provide humanitarian support, instead of working on the frontlines to stop drugs, gang members, and dangerous criminals from entering our country.\xa0To help manage this crisis and alleviate the strain on resources and personnel at the border, CBP established temporary holding facilities in El Paso and the Rio Grande Valley for those who cross the border illegally as they await transfer to ICE for further adjudication of their immigration cases.DHS is taking a “whole of government” approach to confront the ongoing crisis and fulfill the Department\'s humanitarian and security obligations. With DHS facilities at peak capacity, rapid growth in the flow of migrants entering the U.S. through the southern border is straining DHS resources to their breaking point, threatening lives on both sides of the border—including underprivileged families and children at risk from the dangerous journey to the U.S.On May 1, the Administration requested $4.5 billion in emergency appropriations to address the immediate humanitarian crisis at our Southwest border, of which $1.1 billion would support DHS efforts.

Participants confirmed their commitment to further discuss an expert level dialogue.The U.S. and the E.U. briefed each other on recent developments in their migration and border management policies; in particular, the E.U. provided information on the reinforced mandate of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (EBCGA) and on the implementation of the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), two instruments which will further strengthen the E.U.'s border management. Both sides concurred on the vital importance of preventing and combating migrant smuggling and trafficking of human beings and discussed further joint work in these areas.Finally, the E.U. and the U.S. agreed on the importance of advancing further towards reciprocal visa free travel under their respective legal frameworks and, following the May 2019 meeting on visa reciprocity between the U.S., the E.U. and the concerned Member States, welcomed the progress of the five concerned Member States towards meeting the requirements of the Visa Waiver Program, in order to be considered for designation in the program.Reaffirming their commitment to advance together towards common solutions in these areas, the E.U. and the U.S. committed to meet again in the second half of 2019 in Washington, D.C.The meeting was also attended by the E.U. Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, Gilles de Kerchove, the Executive Director of Europol, Catherine De Bolle, the Executive Director of Frontex, Fabrice Leggeri, and the Vice-President of Eurojust, Klaus Meyer-Cabri.", 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/06/20/joint-eu-us-statement-following-eu-us-justice-and-home-affairs-ministerial-meeting', 'source': '国土安全部'}

The Challenge is an S&T collaboration with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS).“I am alarmed with dangerous illicit opioids traveling through our international mail system not only because they feed the devastating opioid epidemic in our country, but because they put our operators at risk,” said Acting Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan. “I am very impressed with the creative detection technologies submitted, and we look forward to deploying new solutions in operational environments.”In Stage 1, the Challenge called for well-developed plans for automated, user-friendly tools and technologies that have the potential to quickly and accurately detect opioids in parcels, without disrupting the flow of mail. Stage 1 submissions closed on April 24, 2019, and the Challenge received 83 submissions from U.S. and international innovators. The finalists are:A judging panel of experts in forensic science, postal operations, drug interdiction, industrial engineering, and artificial intelligence helped to select the eight finalists, according to the selection criteria. Each finalist will receive $100,000 in cash prizes and advance to Stage 2 of the competition.In Stage 2, finalists will participate in a 14-week prototyping accelerator, during which they will develop their plans into testable prototypes and compete for an additional $750,000 in cash prizes. Stage 2 culminates in a live test event hosted by DHS, where finalists will convene for on-site testing of their prototypes. The Challenge expects to award one $500,000 grand prize and one $250,000 prize to a runner-up."A critical part of addressing the addiction crisis is finding new ways to stop the flow of deadly drugs coming into our country. This is exactly why we have taken a whole-of-government approach and launched this competition. The responses from innovators, universities, and technology leaders have been outstanding. We will continue to support the development of these creative solutions that have the potential to detect opioids and ultimately save lives," ONDCP Director Jim Carroll said."A significant challenge in the past few years is the increasing volume of parcels in international mail. Novel technologies are critical to help us screen these parcels for dangerous drugs like fentanyl,” said DHS Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary for Science and Technology William N. Bryan. “We are excited to support these teams as they advance their innovations in the next stage of the Challenge.""We are encouraged by the levels of innovation submitted by these finalists and the possibilities of each technology. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is looking forward to the next steps of the Challenge and finding better ways to identify and stop opioids from coming into our communities and our homes," Chief Postal Inspector Gary Barksdale said.The abuse of opioids such as fentanyl has created an unprecedented public health crisis across the United States. Every day, more than 130 people in the United States die from opioid overdoses. International mail has been identified as a route for illicit opioids entering the United States, commonly transported in nearly pure, powdered form. Consequently, large-scale drug trafficking can occur via very small packages sent in the mail.For more information about the Opioid Detection Challenge, visit opioiddetectionchallenge.com.###', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/06/11/8-finalists-announced-155m-challenge-new-solutions-detect-opioids-international-mail', 'source': '国土安全部'}

He received a briefing from Director Ken Graham and NHC leadership on the operational priorities, capabilities and goals of the NHC, as well as their outlook for the 2019 hurricane season. June 1 marked the beginning of Atlantic hurricane season, which is naturally a busy time for the NHC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). However, DHS and FEMA work throughout the year with our state, local and tribal partners to instill a continual sense of preparedness that increases community resilience in the face of natural disasters.“If past years are any indication, the 2019 hurricane season will test our response and recovery efforts,” McAleenan said. “At DHS and FEMA, we are not only responding to natural disasters as they occur, but building a lasting culture of resilience that will see us through the worst of hurricane seasons.”Finally, the Acting Secretary met with TSA personnel at Miami International Airport to discuss challenges to aviation security. The Acting Secretary viewed a demonstration of a computed tomography machine, which allows screeners to have a more comprehensive, 3-D view of potentially threatening items. This technology is another example of TSA’s innovative methods to maintain aviation security.###', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/06/07/acting-secretary-mcaleenan-views-drug-offload-tours-national-hurricane-center', 'source': '国土安全部'}

McAleenan traveled to Guatemala this week to attend the sixth Northern Triangle Security Ministerial meeting with Ministers of Security and other high-level security officials from the region. During his visit, the Acting Secretary signed a Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Guatemalan Ministry of Government to enhance bilateral law enforcement cooperation in an effort to stem the flow of irregular migration. Acting Secretary McAleenan also met with Guatemalan civil society leaders, indigenous leaders, International NGO leadership and small business leaders to gain a deeper understanding of the root causes driving the high rate of migration from the region and targeted solutions to address them.\xa0The signed MOC will expand areas of bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and Guatemala to target ‘push’ factors like high levels of crime and limited economic opportunity that spur illegal and irregular migration from the Northern Triangle Region. Included in the agreement is a provision on law enforcement training to improve criminal investigations that disrupt human trafficking and drug smuggling networks often run by transnational criminal organizations, who are able to profit from human suffering. The agreement has already resulted in nine arrests of a major drug smuggling organization, showing promise for the effectiveness of the resource and information-sharing agreement.“I am proud to sign this agreement with Minister Enrique Antonio Degenhart,” said Acting Secretary McAleenan. “Through our continued collaboration and partnership, the U.S. and Guatemala are formalizing a number of initiatives to improve the lives and security of our respective citizens by combating human trafficking and the smuggling of illegal goods, helping to limit ‘push’ factors that encourage dangerous irregular migration to the U.S., perpetuating the ongoing crisis at our border.”On Wednesday, McAleenan met with farmers and community leaders from Huehuetenango, a department that has seen three percent of its population immigrate to the United States in the first seven months of this fiscal year.\xa0 He toured an agricultural training facility where rural farmers are taught how to increase productivity to augment their incomes while improving food security and nutrition for their families. McAleenan stressed the importance of public-private partnership in addressing the economic challenges in the Western highlands that are contributing to irregular migration.Acting Secretary McAleenan also met with private sector business leaders and with representatives from Walmart’s corporate social responsibility program in Guatemala “Giving a Hand to Grow” initiative. In both meetings, McAleenan discussed the importance of strengthening the capacity of small and medium-sized businesses to spur economic growth. McAleenan reiterated DHS’s commitment to working with the Government of Guatemala and the private sector to increase economic opportunity. Also noted was that the U.S. has a particular interest in issues related to inequality and violence against women, and is committed to working with Guatemalan public and institutions to improve security, as well as livelihood opportunities for women.On Thursday, Acting Secretary McAleenan spent the morning with First Lady of Guatemala, Patricia Marroquín, touring a migrant Repatriation and Reception Center and observing the safe processing of returning Guatemalan migrants.“I commend the First Lady for her leadership and efforts to support the safe and successful reintegration of returned migrants as well as messaging campaigns to dissuade illegal migration to the United States,” McAleenan emphasized.McAleenan’s trip to Guatemala comes as the migrant crisis at the United States’ Southwest Border intensifies and worsens. April saw over 109,000 migrants apprehended, the highest amount in one month in over a decade. McAleenan’s meetings in Guatemala reflect the Department-wide, “whole-of-government” approach DHS is taking to confront the ongoing border crisis so that the Department is able to fulfill its humanitarian and security mission.', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/05/31/acting-secretary-mcaleenan-signs-bilateral-agreement-confront-factors-driving', 'source': '国土安全部'}

GIDLEY:\xa0 Good evening and thanks for joining the briefing call tonight regarding the crisis at our southern border.\xa0 This call is on the record and it will be conducted by acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Kevin McAleenan and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.There will be brief opening remarks delivered by both gentlemen and then we\'ll open it up for questions.\xa0 Again, the information on this call is on the record.\xa0 And with that, I\'ll turn it over to acting Secretary McAleenan.ACTING SECRETARY MCALEENAN:\xa0 Thanks, Hogan.\xa0 I want to start by offering some context on the situation at the U.S. border that is requiring extraordinary action.\xa0 The situation is both a humanitarian and border security crisis that has become a national emergency.The current influx of illegal crossings into the United States from Mexico is overwhelming the resources of CBP and DHS and has severely impacted the ability of the Department to secure the U.S. border and enforce the immigration laws of the United States.\xa0Over the past 21 days, an average of over 4,500 people have crossed our border illegally or arrived at ports of entry without documents.\xa0 In May of 2017, that number was less than 700 a day.\xa0 The month of May is on pace to be the highest month in crossings in over 12 years and will significantly surpass the record 109,000 in April.Yesterday, a single group of 1,036 families and unaccompanied children simply walked from Juárez, Mexico into the United States illegally as a single group -- the largest group ever apprehended at the border.\xa0U.S. immigration authorities now have over 80,000 people in custody, a record level that is beyond sustainable capacity with current resources.\xa0 Over 7,500 single adults are in custody at the border and Immigration and Customs Enforcement is holding over 50,000.\xa0Most urgently, children are being put in danger daily as transnational criminal organizations smuggle unprecedented numbers of families and children across our borders.\xa0 Over 2,350 unaccompanied children -- the highest level ever -- are currently in custody waiting for days for placements in border stations that cannot provide appropriate conditions for them because Health and Human Services is out of bed space and Congress has failed to act on the administration\'s emergency supplemental request for more than four weeks.\xa0Four hundred children arrived in the last 24 hours alone.\xa0 Four of those children this month have died transiting through Mexico into the United States -- two drowning in a river, both a five-year-old and ten-month-old; and two teenage boys died of infections after receiving medical treatment in federal custody.Over 75,000 families have already transited Mexico to the U.S. border this month alone.\xa0 Incentivized to come now by the smuggling organizations\' advertisements and the fact that families cannot be detained in custody during their immigration proceedings.\xa0We are seeing increasing cases of adults fraudulently presenting with children that are not their own -- over 4,000 this year.\xa0 As one man whose own children had migrated to the U.S. this year told me yesterday while was I was in Guatemala, "A child is like a passport for migration."\xa0Let me clear, the current situation is risking the lives of children every day.\xa0 To address this crisis, Mexico must take significant action to secure their southern border, stop the unlawful flow of migrants across their territory, and attack the criminal groups preying on vulnerable migrants and profiting from these smuggling enterprises.\xa0At any given moment, up to 100,000 migrants are transiting Mexico on their way to the U.S. border.\xa0 Unlike the U.S. border, where crossings can occur in all four states and all along our 2,000-mile border from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico, this visible, predictable movement of migrants from Central America can be much more easily interdicted and occurs largely from the Guatemala into one Mexican border state along a 150-mile stretch of border with both natural and transportation chokepoints.We also have the opportunity to partner with Mexico to align our asylum efforts to ensure that asylum seekers are processed and protected in the first safe space they reach and not allowed to continue on to other countries’ borders.\xa0 We need to take concerted action.\xa0We\'ve also asked Congress to close the gaps in our laws that incentivize this unlawful flow.\xa0 We will continue to engage Mexico and Congress on solutions.\xa0 And the status quo is clearly unacceptable and getting worse.\xa0MR. GIDLEY:\xa0 Thanks, Kevin.\xa0 I really appreciate that.\xa0 I want to turn it over to Chief of Staff Mulvaney now for a brief opening statement as well.\xa0ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF MULVANEY:\xa0 Very briefly, because there\'s hardly anything you could add to that, but if that doesn\'t describe a national emergency -- a crisis -- I\'m not sure what does.\xa0\xa0And for all of the reasons that Kevin just identified, the President indicated his intention tonight to invoke his authorities under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\xa0I take it you saw the tweet -- and I saw the second tweet said that he was going to provide the details tonight.\xa0 Here are the details: Effective\xa0June 1st-- unless some things happen; we could talk about that in a second -- the President intends to levy a -- excuse me, I\'m sorry, I spoke --\xa0June the 1st\xa0-- I can\'t even read my own handwriting, it\'s\xa0June 10th.\xa0\xa0June 10th, we\'ll impose a 5 percent tariff on every single good coming into the United States from Mexico.\xa0 That means across the border, in the air, by sea -- every single good, 5 percent tariff, effective\xa0June 10th.\xa0If the Mexican government is uncapable -- incapable of or unwilling to assist us in resolving the situation at our southern border, that tariff will go to 10 percent\xa0on July 1st, 15 percent\xa0on August 1st, 20 percent\xa0on September 1st, and 25 percent\xa0on October 1st.\xa0 It is our very firm belief that the Mexican government can and needs to do more to help us with the situation on the southern border.\xa0So with that, we\'ll throw it open to questions for a little bit.\xa0 Kevin can take them, I can take them -- however you want to work it, Hogan.\xa0Q\xa0\xa0\xa0 Hi, this is Andrew Feinberg with Breakfast Media.\xa0 Thanks for doing this.\xa0 So it appears that the President\'s solution to the migrant crisis is to raise taxes on Americans.\xa0 How do you think the economy is going to react to this?\xa0 And do you think it could threaten the gains that the President likes to brag about?\xa0 And also, does the President understand that Mexico is not going to pay these tariffs -- that they are not going to pay them, Mexican companies aren\'t -- that Americans will pay these?\xa0ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF MULVANEY:\xa0 Let\'s make a couple things perfectly clear: Americans are paying for this right now.\xa0 Illegal immigration comes at a cost.\xa0 The American taxpayer is paying for what\'s going on at the crisis -- at the border.\xa0We -- all of a us -- what was the second question?\xa0 I can\'t -- it\'s late and I cannot read my own handwriting.\xa0 What was your second part of your question?Q\xa0\xa0\xa0 The two questions were what effect do you think this is going to have on the economy?\xa0 And the second question was if the President understands that he\'s raising taxes on Americans to punish Mexico.ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF MULVANEY:\xa0 And again, this -- the second -- the answer to the second about the economy is the same as the first, which is this is already impacting the economy negatively.\xa0 National security is the first and foremost priority for any President of the United States.\xa0 And this President will do everything that he legally can to defend the nation.Again, I hope you were able to be in the first part of the call and heard the statistics of what\'s happening at the border.\xa0 If that is not a national emergency, I don\'t what is.\xa0\xa0So the President has asked Congress to help.\xa0 Congress has failed to help.\xa0 I can personally tell you it\'s been at least six weeks since I met with Senate Democrats to literally beg them for (inaudible).\xa0 And instead of helping us, they left town.\xa0\xa0So now we are asking Mexico to do what it can because Congress will not.\xa0 This President will defend the nation.\xa0 He will defend the southern border.\xa0 If that means taking the tariffs to 25 percent, that means taking the tariffs to 25 percent.\xa0 We hope -- sincerely hope -- it does not come to that.We actually have some level of confidence that the Mexican government will be able to help us in a very, very timely fashion.\xa0 We could talk about that more in a later question if you want to.\xa0 We really do not want to do this, but we do this in order to protect the country.\xa0Q\xa0\xa0\xa0 Hi, this Kaitlan Collins with CNN.\xa0 Thanks so much for doing this.\xa0 Obviously, the Vice President traveled to Canada today to talk about the USMCA deal.\xa0 And my question is, would this new threat -- would that affect the USMCA?\xa0 Does it violate the agreement?\xa0 And would it require the U.S. to withdraw with that?ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF MULVANEY:\xa0 No, the two are absolutely not linked.\xa0 Keep in mind, this is an action that we take that is related to an immigration matter.\xa0 And if the Mexicans aren\'t -- if the Mexican government is able to do what we think they can do, they have some of the strongest immigration laws in the world in their country.\xa0 We fully believe they have the ability to stop people coming from their southern border.\xa0And if they\'re able to do that, these tariffs will either not go into place or will be removed after they go into place.\xa0 That is separate and apart from the USMCA, which is a trade matter.\xa0 These are not tariffs as part of a trade dispute.\xa0 These are tariffs as part of an immigration problem.\xa0 The USMCA is a trade matter and completely separate.Q\xa0\xa0\xa0 Hi, this is Kayla Tausche from CNBC.\xa0 I wanted to ask about what ideas were left on the cutting room floor to pursue this strategy, because it is an economic instrument that is being used to solve a different type of policy matter.\xa0 So I\'m curious what else came up in the discussion for how to solve this.\xa0 And also, what you would see as a sufficient response from the Mexican government?ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF MULVANEY:\xa0 Yes.\xa0 Kayla, a couple things on that.\xa0 I\'m not going to speak to the things we didn\'t do or the deliberate process that we go through.\xa0 That\'s just not appropriate and we won\'t -- I won\'t address that. \xa0\xa0But I will tell you that we are specifically -- I think -- I don\'t know if you all have seen the statement that we have put or not -- but we specifically mentioned, in regards to an approving situation, that it will be at our discretion.\xa0 We\'re trying to build in the ability here to look to the Mexican government to make progress immediately.\xa0 That\'s the key here.\xa0 This needs to -- this is an urgent problem.\xa0We -- one of the things that frustrates us in the White House so often, that when we talk to Congress, especially the Democrats, it (inaudible) -- they talk about ideas that could fix things in six months or eight months or a year.\xa0 The crisis at the border is now.\xa0 The crisis at the border is urgent.\xa0 And we are interested in seeing the Mexican government react tonight, tomorrow.\xa0They have -- I believe it\'s like (inaudible) days to (inaudible) progress on this.\xa0 And we\'re hopeful that they will.\xa0 And there are things that they can do.\xa0 And Kevin can speak to that if you like -- things that the Mexican government -- we\'ve talked to them about doing.\xa0 They know they can do it.\xa0 We know they can do it.\xa0 That\'s what we\'re -- that\'s what we’re more interested in.\xa0Kevin, do you want to speak to that -- some of the steps the government of Mexico can take?\xa0ACTING SECRETARY MCALEENAN:\xa0 Sure.\xa0 I would highlight three.\xa0 First, operational security on their southern border with Guatemala.\xa0 They have increased somewhat they interdictions of migrates entering Mexico from Guatemala, but it\'s less than one fifth of what we\'re seeing at the border on average.\xa0 They need to step up their security efforts at their southern border.\xa0 And they have natural chokepoints leading away from the border of Chiapas and Guatemala, into Mexico and on the way to the U.S.\xa0\xa0\xa0Two, we need to target an attack to transnational criminal organizations.\xa0 This is an organized smuggling effort.\xa0 The logistical effort to move 100,000 people through a country every four weeks is immense.\xa0 This is noticeable.\xa0 It involves commercial bus lines that are controlled by criminal organizations.\xa0 We need Mexico to crack down on these operations in their territory.And third, we want to work with Mexico to align on asylum.\xa0 We need to be able to protect people in the first safe country they arrive in -- really, all through the hemisphere, but certainly with our partner to the south.So those three areas I would highlight as key opportunities for continued and enhanced partnership.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Q\xa0\xa0\xa0 Hi, this is Alex Pfeiffer from Tucker Carlson Tonight.\xa0 I was wondering, did the White House talk with any congressional leaders before announcing this decision?\xa0 Were they supportive of it?ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF MULVANEY:\xa0 I will tell you, without going into specifics, that we were in communication with leadership in both chambers.\xa0 Obviously, we talked to Republicans more than we did Democrats.\xa0\xa0Q\xa0\xa0\xa0 And were the Republicans supportive of it?ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF MULVANEY:\xa0 They were.\xa0 There were some questions that were raised regarding the authorities and we were able to brief -- the White House Counsel\'s Office was able to brief a couple of, especially, the senators who were interested in going over the authorities under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\xa0 And we feel like we were able to get them more comfortable with that.\xa0So yeah, I think we were able to (inaudible).Q\xa0\xa0\xa0 Hello?\xa0 Hello?MR. GIDLEY:\xa0 Go ahead.\xa0Q\xa0\xa0\xa0 Hi.\xa0 Thank you.\xa0 This is Kat Lister with (inaudible).\xa0 I’m just wondering: What products will be levied to the 5 percent tariff\xa0on June 10th?ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF MULVANEY:\xa0 All of them.\xa0Q\xa0\xa0\xa0 Hey, this is Steven with Sinclair Broadcast Group.\xa0 Thanks for doing the call.\xa0 I wanted to ask, what is -- you all say it\'s at your discretion.\xa0 What is a win for the United States?\xa0 Is it a drop in 15 percent in immigration?\xa0 Is it 50 percent?\xa0 What\'s the win for the Trump White House?\xa0And if the United States government is saying, you know, "We can\'t handle all these people," what is the message to Mexico, saying "You need to keep them there," if Mexico is not able to handle them either?ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF MULVANEY:\xa0 We -- again, we were -- specifically referencing our statement that this is --whether we\'re going handle this on an ad hoc basis.\xa0 We did not set a specific percentage, did not set a specific number.\xa0 It\'s a very fluid situation.\xa0For example, if we said we wanted to lower it -- we want them to increase their apprehensions by 1,000 -- but tomorrow we get 7,000 people crossing the border, that doesn’t solve the problem.\xa0 We are going to judge success here by the number of people crossing the border, and that number needs to start coming down immediately in a significant and substantial number.So we\'re going to take this and look at it on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis.Q\xa0\xa0\xa0 Hey, Mick.\xa0 Ben White from Politico.\xa0 Thanks for doing the call.\xa0 I just wonder, when you briefed Republicans and some Democrats on the use of this authority, what was the argument for why the IEEPA is a legitimate usage here for, you know, this unrelated immigration problem?\xa0 I mean, my reading of the statute is this would be a pretty atypical usage of it that\'s likely to face some challenges.ACTING CHIEF OF STAFF MULVANEY:\xa0 Actually, in all fairness, I\'d rather have the White House Counsel\'s Office address that because they had the direct conversations with the members on the Hill.\xa0 So, and I was not -- did not participate in those.\xa0\xa0And let me be clear -- I think I said something tongue in cheek that you just took literally, which is I don\'t believe we spoke to any Democrats in advance of this.\xa0 So when I said before we obviously talked to more Republicans than Democrats, that\'s a true statement, but the number of Democrats, I believe was zero.\xa0So, but if you want to, we can reach out separately on the legal authority because that did come up in conversations with several Republican folks on the Hill -- specifically, a couple of senators that I won\'t name.\xa0\xa0MR. GIDLEY:\xa0 All right, thanks everybody.\xa0 I just want to repeat the reminder to the reporters on the call that the two folks from the White House were the acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.\xa0 And the call is on the record.\xa0Thank you very much.\xa0END \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa08:23 P.M.

The projects covered by the waivers include up to approximately 78 miles of new bollard wall in place of dilapidated and outdated designs, in addition to road construction and improvement and lighting installation. The waivers were published in the Federal Register on May 15, 2019.To support DHS’s actions under Section 102 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, as amended (IIRIRA), DHS requested that the Department of Defense (DoD), pursuant to its authority under 10 U.S.C. § 284(b)(7), assist with the construction of fences, roads and lighting within specified locations of the border in order to block drug-smuggling corridors across the international boundary between the United States and Mexico. The Acting Secretary of Defense determined that the projects covered by these waivers meet the statutory requirements of 10 U.S.C. § 284(b)(7).\xa0 As such, these projects will be funded by appropriations available to DoD.

McAleenan will travel to the U.S. Southern Border on Saturday to meet with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Defense (DoD) frontline personnel who have been surged to the Rio Grande Valley area as part of the interagency response to the ongoing humanitarian and security crisis.Joined by Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, the Acting Secretary will receive a border security update from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) officials, taking place at the McAllen Border Patrol Station. The pair will then tour the McAllen Border Patrol Station and participate in a “muster” with National Guard Troops and DHS personnel at the McAllen border wall.Importantly, the support of DoD allows DHS to crack down on criminal organizations who exploit vulnerable migrants, helping save people who were drowning in rivers, who were gravely injured, and those who were left for dead by smugglers. In total, Border Patrol agents rescued 4,311 individuals in FY 2018, and in the first four months of FY 2019 rescued 861 individuals.In response to the largest influx of migrants crossing the southern over in over a decade, DHS is taking a “whole of government” approach to confront the ongoing crisis and fulfill the Department's humanitarian and security obligations. With DHS facilities at peak capacity, rapid growth in the flow of migrants entering the U.S. through the southern border is straining DHS resources to their breaking point, threatening lives on both sides of the border—including underprivileged families and children at risk from the dangerous journey to the U.S.Recently released data from CBP show that in the month of April alone, CBP apprehended over 109,000 migrants—the largest monthly total in more than a decade.With increased migrant flows, smugglers and traffickers are forcing more people into inhumane and unsafe conditions.\xa0 In one study, more than 30 percent of women reported being sexually assaulted along the way, and 70 percent of all migrants reported experiencing violence. In most years, DHs would encounter only one or two groups of more than 100 migrants arrive at our borders. Already in this fiscal year, CBP has seen more than 90 large groups of over 100 migrants.DHS continues to urge lawmakers to provide the men and women of DHS with the appropriate tools and resources to achieve their mission as they confront ever-evolving challenges and circumstances. Given the scale of the crisis, the Department will exhaust its resources before the end of this fiscal year without the supplemental funding requested by the administration.\xa0###", 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/05/11/acting-secretary-mcaleenan-returns-rio-grande-valley-assess-whole-government', 'source': '国土安全部'}

McAleenan visited the National Vetting Governance Board on Friday to congratulate and thank representatives from multiple agencies for their work on standing up the new National Vetting Center (NVC).In attendance were members from the Department of Justice, Department of State, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, along with several representatives from the Intelligence Community (IC).“Led by DHS, the National Vetting Center is an essential and long-awaited component of the U.S. government’s national vetting enterprise,” Acting Secretary McAleenan said. “The NVC fills a critical need to improve how federal officials identify individuals who may present a threat to national security, border security, homeland security, or public safety. The NVC is just another step in realizing the 9/11 Commission’s recommendations regarding the need for interagency collaboration to ‘connect the dots’ and make more informed decisions about threats to the United States.”The NVC strengthens, simplifies, and streamlines the complex way intelligence and law enforcement information is used to inform operational decisions, allowing agencies to contribute their unique information while complying with applicable law and policy and maintaining robust privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties protections. Furthermore, the NVC’s technology process allows for information held by national security partners to be checked before the travel benefit is issued, ensuring we keep potential threats away from our borders.The Acting Secretary expressed gratitude to the group, highlighting the immediate impact on the of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)’s mission. “Through the NVC, CBP can now receive near-real time responses from national security partners for more than 35,000 Electronic System for Travel Authorization applications each day.”However, he stressed that while DHS is tasked with managing the NVC, the NVC process that has been designed is a resource for the entire government and will support additional vetting programs in the future.National Security Presidential Memorandum-9, signed Feb. 6, 2018, called for the establishment of the NVC. The Memorandum also directed the creation of an Intelligence Community Support Element, which facilitates, guides, and coordinates all IC efforts to use classified intelligence and other relevant information within IC holdings in direct support of the NVC. The Center officially began initial operations in December 2018 and currently supports the vetting of visa waiver travelers.View the fact sheet on the National Vetting Center here.', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/05/10/acting-secretary-mcaleenan-visits-national-vetting-governance-board-commend', 'source': '国土安全部'}

McAleenan announced that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Labor (DOL) will publish a joint rule making available an additional 30,000 H-2B temporary nonagricultural worker visas for Fiscal Year 2019. These supplemental H-2B visas are available only to returning workers who received an H-2B visa, or were otherwise granted H-2B status, during one of the last three fiscal years (FY 2016, 2017, or 2018), and availability is restricted by prioritizing only those businesses who would suffer irreparable harm without the additional workers.Returning H-2B workers have demonstrated their ability to abide by the terms and conditions of the H-2B program and, therefore, are less likely to remain in the United States and work without authorization after their legal status has expired. H-2B workers often return to the same employer year after year on a seasonal basis, are vetted, trusted, and can have their visas approved more rapidly given their known history.“The Department of Homeland Security continues to urge lawmakers to pursue a long-term legislative fix that both meets employers’ temporary needs while fulfilling the President’s Buy American and Hire American executive order to spur higher wages and employment rates for U.S. workers,” said Acting Secretary McAleenan. “The truth is that Congress is in the best position to establish the appropriate number of H-2B visas that American businesses should be allocated without harming U.S. workers. Therefore, Congress – not DHS – should be responsible for determining whether the annual numerical limitations for H-2B workers set by Congress need to be modified and by how much, and for setting parameters to ensure that enough workers are available to meet employers’ temporary needs throughout the year.”\xa0Details on the increase in H-2B Nonimmigrant Visas for FY 2019 can be found alongside the temporary final rule, which is\xa0posted for public inspection.DHS is committed to ensuring that our immigration system is implemented lawfully and that American workers are protected.

From enabling movement between the private and public sectors to supporting our workforce’s training, education, and development, the President’s action today sets the course to expand and sustain the workforce and ensure America keeps its competitive edge in the critical field of cybersecurity.”Under the Cybersecurity Workforce Executive Order, the Department of Homeland Security will work with partners from around the federal government on several initiatives to strengthen the workforce. DHS will create the Federal Cybersecurity Rotational Program, in which Information Technology (IT) and cybersecurity practitioners in the federal government can serve temporary assignments in DHS, and vice versa, sharing knowledge and cybersecurity best practices, undergoing training, and providing invaluable, varied experiences to the workforce. Additionally, DHS will identify aptitude assessments for use in identifying current employees who would be excellent candidates to work in IT and cybersecurity.Together with the Department of Defense, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management Budget, and other partner agencies, DHS will plan the President’s Cup Cybersecurity Competition to spur competition as well as challenge and reward the best federal and military cybersecurity practitioners and teams.\xa0DHS and the Department of Commerce will create a National Cybersecurity Workforce Consultative Process, in which stakeholders from the private and public sectors, from the federal level to local and tribal governments, academia, and others, will assess the cybersecurity workforce and make recommendations to strengthen its skill sets.

Importantly, this vital benefit eases some of the challenges associated with finding employment and helps military spouses re-establish their careers after a PCS move.The Department of Defense (DOD) previously established a partnership with LinkedIn allowing DOD spouses to receive a free LinkedIn premium membership for a year both before and after each PCS move, but the initial agreement excluded the U.S. Coast Guard.“Military spouse employment is a very important aspect of a strong and resilient military family, “ said Mrs. Pence. “ Our work to develop a partnership with LinkedIn to include Coast Guard military spouses with LinkedIn premium access started last fall. We commend Microsoft and LinkedIn for working with the United States Coast Guard to expand their program to Coast Guard military spouses. This new collaboration will help spouses with employment opportunities and will make job hunting easier.”Second Lady Pence has become a champion for awareness of the challenges unique to military spouses, including obtaining employment after a PCS move. A proud military mom, whose son serves in the Marines, Mrs. Pence understands the struggles associated with repeated moves of military families. Second Lady Pence advocated to LinkedIn to facilitate expanding this benefit to include the Coast Guard, the only Armed Force in the Department of Homeland Security.“We are committed to helping as much as possible, and today I’m glad we can make that next move a little bit easier through this partnership with LinkedIn,” McAleenan said. “And I want to thank LinkedIn for partnering with us on this.

Trump announced the Initiative to Stop Opioid Abuse and Reduce Drug Supply and Demand on March 19, 2018, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has embarked on an aggressive inter-agency operation to implement the president’s initiative and to stem the flow of opioids into U.S. communities.“Through innovation, partnership and prevention, the men and women of DHS are working to curtail the flow of illicit substances at the source and at the border—before they reach our communities." said DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan. “Our Department will continue to improve its efforts to interdict illicit drugs at or before they reach our borders, and remains committed to working with federal, state and local partners and relevant stakeholders to disrupt and dismantle the production and movement of these substances devastating American families and poisoning our communities. By mobilizing the entire administration to address this crisis, President Trump is galvanizing all of our resources to combat this deadly epidemic.”DHS currently leads U.S. Government efforts to interdict illicit opioids and their analogues at or before reaching U.S. borders. In fact, DHS is seizing and blocking more fentanyl shipments than ever before. In Fiscal Year 2018 (FY 18), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) together seized almost 5,000 lbs. of fentanyl combined—or more than 1.2 billion lethal doses and enough to kill every American by overdose four times.In FY 18, ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) seized over 1 million lbs. of illegal narcotics, including 2,737 lbs. of fentanyl and 7,103 lbs. of heroin, and has made over 11,400 narcotics-related criminal arrests over the same time period—of which over 720 were for fentanyl-related offenses.During the first six months of Fiscal Year 2019 (FY 19), ICE HSI fentanyl seizures totaled 1,340 lbs., compared to 1,314 lbs. for the same period in FY 18. CBP total fentanyl seizures from the Office of Field Operations (OFO) at ports of entry totaled over 939 lbs., compared to 914 lbs. during the same period in FY 18.Additionally, DHS is blocking more fentanyl shipments through the mail. Over the last two fiscal years, CBP has detected more packages containing fentanyl in our mail —an 810% increase from FY16—keeping it from reaching American communities. Over 50 percent of all international packages are now being scanned.CBP operates within major international mail facilities, inspecting international mail and parcels arriving from more than 180 countries. Additionally, CBP and the U.S. Postal Service are working to increase the amount of advance information we receive on international mail. This advance information enables ICE and other agencies to identify networks of foreign suppliers and domestic importers that are responsible for smuggling fentanyl into the United States.\xa0These networks have been targeted for investigation and prosecution.View the DHS Fact Sheet OnlineDHS remains committed to both stopping illicit opioids and opioid analogues at their source and preventing them from coming into our country.DHS is using a vast array of tools to confront the crisis.DHS recognizes that combating the illegal flow of opioids also means ensuring they do not get into the hands of those who would abuse them. That is why Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin K. McAleenan today spoke to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) employees to encourage their ongoing work to confront the opioid crisis, urging continued vigilance and noting the critical role they can play in the National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, which aims to provide a safe, convenient, and responsible means of disposing of prescription drugs, while also educating the general public about the potential for abuse of medications. \xa0', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/04/24/mcaleenan-through-innovation-partnership-and-prevention-dhs-confronting-opioid', 'source': '国土安全部'}

{'title': 'Readout from Acting Secretary McAleenan’s Trip to McAllen', 'publish_time': '2019-04-19 19:45:15', 'content': 'WASHINGTON - Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan travelled to McAllen, Texas on Tuesday and Wednesday to assess the strategic and operational challenges faced by law enforcement and local communities as they work to confront the ongoing humanitarian and security crisis at the U.S. Southern Border.The Acting Secretary joined the U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) Tuesday for a midnight shift tour of the U.S.-Mexico border – including key crossing points and staging areas central to human smuggling – in order to assess the strategic and operational challenges faced by law enforcement operations in the region. McAleenan expressed appreciation for agents’ unwavering dedication in the face of record migration flows and emphasized the necessity of remaining steadfast in executing DHS’ mission.Currently, DHS facilities along the Southwest Border are at peak capacity, while officers and agents lack the resources to adequately administer humanitarian services to migrants.On Wednesday, Acting Secretary McAleenan toured the Humanitarian Respite Center operated by Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley (CCRGV), a local nongovernmental organization providing services to migrants once they are released from custody, followed by meetings with the members of the Center’s leadership. There, McAleenan discussed CCRGV’s needs related to the care of migrants in the area and expressed appreciation for the organization’s continued dedication to the vulnerable and migrant populations. McAleenan then hosted a roundtable with local mayors, stressing the need to work together to achieve security at the border while providing critical services to migrants.“We recognize the strain that this humanitarian crisis has placed on service providers and communities such as yours along the border – it affects the men and women of DHS as well,” McAleenan emphasized. “We hope to better coordinate our efforts to manage the migrants in our care. But we are also working to address the factors driving this crisis.”Throughout his trip, McAleenan reiterated that the border security emergency and humanitarian crisis are inextricably linked. In an address to the media, McAleenan explained that drug smugglers and human traffickers are using the humanitarian crisis as cover while DHS resources are diverted to medical care and other humanitarian duties associated with managing large groups of families.The Acting Secretary also acknowledged the need for more resources to manage flows of families and provide care to children.“We are taking aggressive action to mitigate the crisis, and protect vulnerable people in our custody by expanding medical care, creating temporary facilities, improving transportation, using additional resources from across DHS while seeking continued support from interagency partners throughout the Federal government,” he said.The Acting Secretary called on Congress to enact legislation that will offer long-lasting solutions to the border crisis. \xa0“We are imploring Congress to provide the resources we need for enhancing our humanitarian and border security efforts, and, most importantly, to work with us on targeted solutions to restore integrity to our immigration system and remove the incentives for families and children to cross our border illegally.” Specifically, he requested legislative fixes that would allow DHS to hold families together in custody, treat all children equally by allowing the U.S. to return Central American children to their home countries, eliminate asylum fraud, and protect vulnerable populations by allowing individuals to apply for asylum from their home countries rather than taking the dangerous trek north.DHS and its federal law enforcement partners are doing everything to confront the worsening security and humanitarian crisis. DHS has taken a full-fledged “disaster response,” including appointing a lead federal official for interagency action and leveraging the National Response Coordination Center (NRCC). DHS agencies “surged” resources and personnel from across the Department toward border security and migration management, including immediately redeploying hundreds of CBP personnel from field operations and ports of entry to assist with the response to the crisis. By reassigning these personnel, USBP agents will be freed up from humanitarian response and enabled to return to critical security operations.# # #', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/04/19/readout-acting-secretary-mcaleenan-s-trip-mcallen', 'source': '国土安全部'}

McAleenan today released the following statement on the Homeland Security Advisory Committee’s report on CBP Families and Children Care:“Today, a panel of experts under the DHS Homeland Security Advisory Committee - a nonpartisan federal advisory committee - issued a report on the current humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border. The \'Emergency Interim Report on CBP Families and Children Care\' made a series of important findings and recommendations to address the crisis that will form key elements of the Department’s response in the coming weeks."The unprecedented surge in unaccompanied children and family unit migration is overwhelming our ability to provide humanitarian aid within our immigration system. The reasonable changes proposed by this nonpartisan panel, could dramatically reduce migration of family units from Central America, help eliminate dangerous and illegal border crossings, as well as improve the care of children who are brought on this harrowing journey. These recommendations are essential to secure our border and for the safety and welfare of children living in Central America and elsewhere who will continue to make this dangerous trek north.“I want to thank the Committee for their diligent and rapid work in producing this report. This emergency report should help inform decision makers throughout the government, and I look forward to discussing the findings with Congress in order to find a common path forward."The recommendations included in the report are emergency legislative recommendations; emergency regulatory changes; establishing temporary regional processing centers for all family units; co-locate necessary personnel to facilitate rapid adjudication of asylum claims of family units within the regional processing centers; propose and negotiate a North American Family Protection Initiative (NAFPI) that includes the essential elements of a Safe Third\u200e Agreement with Mexico; increase contracted medical and transport professionals; provide additional training and child exploitation safeguards; and for the Acting Secretary to name a DHS Commander/Coordinator to assure a whole of government approach to achieve these goals.Click here to see the full report.# # #', 'country': '美国', 'url': 'https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/04/16/acting-secretary-mcaleenan-nonpartisan-committee-report-recommendations-essential', 'source': '国土安全部'}

{'title': 'DHS Announces Funding Opportunity for Fiscal Year 2019 Preparedness Grants', 'publish_time': '2019-04-12 14:01:07', 'content': 'On April 12, Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Deputy Secretary David P. Pekoske announced the release of Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Notices of Funding Opportunity for eight DHS preparedness grant programs totaling more than $1.7 billion. The grant programs provide funding to state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, as well as transportation authorities, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector, to improve the nation’s readiness in preventing, protecting against, responding to, recovering from and mitigating terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies.\xa0The grants reflect the Department’s focus on funding for programs that address our nation’s immediate security needs and ensure public safety in our communities.“The administration remains committed to strengthening the security and resilience of our state and local communities,” Pekoske said.\xa0“The DHS grant programs are flexible by design and will be used to help address evolving threats.\xa0They will go toward building and sustaining capabilities across all levels of government and the whole community to maximize preparedness.”The FY 2019 grant guidance will continue to focus on the nation’s highest risk areas, including urban areas that face the most significant threats. For FY 2019, the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) will enhance regional preparedness and capabilities by funding 31 high-threat, high-density urban areas.\xa0This represents Congressional intent to limit FY 2019 UASI funding to those Urban Areas that represent up to 85 percent of the nationwide risk, as stated in the Explanatory Statement accompanying the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2019 (Pub. L. No. 116-6).Consistent with previous grant guidance, dedicated funding is provided for law enforcement and terrorism prevention throughout the country to prepare for, prevent and respond to pre-operational activity and other crimes that are precursors or indicators of terrorist activity.Grant recipients are encouraged to use grant funding to maintain and sustain current critical core capabilities through investments in training and exercises, updates to current planning and procedures, and lifecycle replacement of equipment.\xa0New capabilities that are built using homeland security grant funding must be deployable if needed to support regional and national efforts.\xa0All capabilities being built or sustained must have a clear linkage to the core capabilities articulated in the National Preparedness Goal.Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG)—provides more than $350 million to assist state, local, tribal, territorial governments in enhancing and sustaining all-hazards emergency management capabilities.Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP)—provides more than $1 billion for states and urban areas to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism and other threats.Since the enactment of the 9/11 Act, FEMA has required states to ensure that at least 25 percent of the total funds awarded to them under SHSP and UASI are dedicated toward law enforcement terrorism prevention activities (LETPA). The total LETPA allocation can be satisfied from SHSP, UASI, or both. In addition, states must obligate at least 80 percent of the funds awarded under SHSP and UASI to local or tribal units of government within 45 days of receipt of the funds.Tribal Homeland Security Grant Program (THSGP)—provides $10 million to eligible tribal nations to implement preparedness initiatives to help strengthen the nation against risk associated with potential terrorist attacks and other hazards.Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP)—provides $60 million to support target hardening and other physical security enhancements for nonprofit organizations that are at high risk of a terrorist attack. This year, $50 million is provided to nonprofits in UASI-designated urban areas, and $10 million is provided to nonprofits located in any state or territory.Intercity Passenger Rail - Amtrak (IPR) Program—provides $10 million to protect critical surface transportation infrastructure and the traveling public from acts of terrorism and increase the resilience of the Amtrak rail system.Port Security Grant Program (PSGP)—provides $100 million to help protect critical port infrastructure from terrorism, enhance maritime domain awareness, improve port-wide maritime security risk management, and maintain or reestablish maritime security mitigation protocols that support port recovery and resiliency capabilities.Transit Security Grant Program (TSGP)—provides $88 million to owners and operators of transit systems to protect critical surface transportation and the traveling public from acts of terrorism and to increase the resilience of transit infrastructure.Intercity Bus Security Grant Program (IBSGP)—provides $2 million to owners and operators of intercity bus systems to protect critical surface transportation infrastructure and the traveling public from acts of terrorism and to increase the resilience of transit infrastructure.All preparedness Notices of Funding Opportunities can be found at www.grants.gov.
